# Features

The catalog of what the three packages of this pack do: `dhis2w-fhir` (`d2w fhir`: scaffold a
project, generate an Implementation Guide from DHIS2 metadata, validate an instance, forward
captured data), `dhis2w-fhir-serve` (the read-and-capture facade and its UI) and
`dhis2w-fhir-engine` (FHIRPath, CQL and quality measures over FHIR-shaped data). The guide series
teaches them in order; this page lists every capability in one place.

## FHIR IG Toolchain

**Packages:** `dhis2w-fhir`, `dhis2w-fhir-serve` | **Install:** `uv tool install "dhis2w-cli[fhir,serve]"`

Turn a DHIS2 instance into a published FHIR R4 Implementation Guide, serve that
guide as a read-and-capture facade, and drain what was captured back into DHIS2.
The version-neutral `fhir` plugin is the `dhis2w-fhir` package, which `d2w`
mounts through the `dhis2w.plugins.v1` entry point when the `dhis2w-cli[fhir]`
extra installs it; the facade is `dhis2w-fhir-serve`, pulled in by the
`dhis2w-cli[serve]` extra so an install that only generates stays FastAPI-free.

Four verbs over one project directory - `init`, `generate`, `validate`,
`serve` - plus `forward` to close the loop and `doctor` to drive the whole
chain in one command.

### Scaffold a project

`d2w fhir init` scaffolds a dockerized SUSHI project.

- **`--template <name>`** scaffolds the project pre-populated from a guide
  already generated against a real DHIS2 instance, so it compiles and serves
  without reaching one; `--list-templates` names what the install carries.
  Three templates ride the wheel (`aggregate-minimal`, `event-program`,
  `patient-summary`); the rest of `examples/igs/` scaffolds from a
  checkout. The template's own `[generate]` keys land inside the `[generate]`
  table the scaffold renders and every table below them is appended, so a
  template stating `concept_code_source` produces one `[generate]` table rather
  than a file that is not TOML. An unknown name is refused naming every template
  the listing names.
- **A bundled payload is the tree today's generator writes.** All three are cut
  from the DHIS2 demo database every `play.im.dhis2.org` server and the seeded
  local stack carry, so each UID a `selection.toml` names exists on an instance
  anyone can reach. Regenerating one needs an instance; catching a payload
  nobody regenerated does not - `test_fhir_template_payloads.py` emits one
  Location from a fixture organisation unit and holds every bundled Location to
  the shape it produces, profile, identifier slices, translated name and level
  extension alike. `scaffold/projects/README.md` is the regeneration procedure.
- **An example is a template only when it declares itself one.** Each guide of
  `examples/igs/` carries a `template.toml`: `scaffolds = true` with the
  `summary` the listing prints, or `scaffolds = false` with the `refusal`
  `--template` prints instead. `refused-names` is the second kind - the exhibit
  for a selection `d2w fhir generate` refuses on the first hostile name, which
  leaves the foundation target on disk and nothing after it, so there is no
  generated tree to lay down and nothing `make sushi` can compile - so it is out
  of the listing, and `--template refused-names` states what it demonstrates
  rather than scaffolding a project it would then tell you to compile.
- **`init` refuses what the IG publisher cannot build.** A `--title` or `--name`
  carrying `<` or `>` is refused naming the flag and the character, because the
  publisher strict-parses the pages it writes them into and aborts its last pass
  hours in. A `--name` outside the FHIR computer-friendly shape
  (`^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,254}$`) is refused with the rule stated, because SUSHI
  rewrites such a name without saying so; the name derived from `--id` conforms.
  Each `--data-set` / `--event-program` / `--tracker-program` UID is checked for
  the DHIS2 shape (eleven characters, a letter then ten letters or digits), and
  a `--registry-path` is refused when no directory stands at it, resolved from
  the new project's own root as the scaffolded `fhir.toml` reads it.
- **`--force` reports a rewrite as a rewrite.** A file that already stood there
  is reported `overwritten` and counted apart from `created`, and the run closes
  by saying how many files it replaced and that their contents - `fhir.toml` and
  every hand-written line included - are gone. There is no confirmation prompt:
  the CLI stays non-interactive and the honesty is in the report.

- **A `uv` project.** `pyproject.toml` declares `dhis2w-cli` + `dhis2w-fhir` +
  `dhis2w-fhir-serve`, which resolve from PyPI as one release - each package's
  dependency floors hold the `d2w` binary, the plugin behind `d2w fhir`, and the
  server behind `d2w fhir serve` to the same version. The committed `uv.lock`
  pins the exact one every make target drives through `uv run d2w`; a
  `.python-version` of `3.13` pins the interpreter beside it. A commented
  `[tool.uv.sources]` block in the same file is the opt-in for tracking the
  repository's `main` branch instead.
- **The rest of the tree.** `fhir.toml`, `sushi-config.yaml`, the Makefile, the
  Dockerfile, and a `.gitignore` covering `.venv/` and the generated
  `ig/input/resources/` but never the lock nor `ig/input/fsh/`. `load/` and
  `.serve/` are gitignored too.
- **Seeding the selection.** `--data-set` / `--event-program` / `--tracker-program`
  seed the questionnaire targets, with the option sets those targets reference
  unioned into the terminology selection.
- **`--status`** seeds `[ig] status`; **`--publisher-url`** opts into a
  `publisher.url` in `sushi-config.yaml`; **`--profile`** seeds the top-level
  `profile` key so the scaffolded project reads an instance without a flag
  (offline - the name is written as given, never resolved against
  `profiles.toml`); **`--org-unit-root`** seeds the organisation unit subtree the project
  publishes (checked for UID shape, and under `--with-registry` written into both
  projects, which have to mean the same organisation units); **`--org-unit-max-level`**
  seeds the organisation-unit depth cap;
  **`--geometry`** seeds `[generate.organisation_units] geometry` (`full`,
  `position` or `none`), landing in the registry package under
  `--with-registry` and refused for a guide naming a registry package;
  **`--with-registry`** scaffolds the guide *and* the registry package it depends
  on, as `registry/` and `guide/` under one directory plus a Makefile driving
  both in the order that resolves and a README describing the pair - the
  registry's id is the guide's with `.registry` appended, its canonical the
  guide's with `/registry`, and `root` and `max_level` reach both because the two
  selections have to mean the same units; `--publishes`, `--template` and every
  `--registry-*` are refused beside it, each naming what to drop. That Makefile
  runs its own targets one at a time, so `make -j2 build` and an inherited `-j`
  build the registry to completion before the guide starts, while each project's
  own make still parallelises; the cost is that a `-j` no longer shortens `make
  generate`, whose two reads of the instance are independent, so
  `generate-registry` and `generate-guide` are each a target to run in its own
  shell. `make update` there moves both projects to the current release - each
  one's own `make update`, then a refresh of the pair through the guide's moved
  toolchain. `make refresh` there is each project's refresh done once for the
  pair: both cleaned, the shared image rebuilt once rather than twice, both
  generated, both validated non-fatally - each grades the instance by what it
  publishes - then the registry built before the guide.
  `d2w fhir init --refresh` on that directory refreshes both projects and
  the two files no project's `fhir.toml` describes: the Makefile is the
  scaffold's own and is rewritten whole, and the README takes the line rule every
  other file takes, so a deployment note written into it is reported and kept
  while the guide's title on its cover and the registry canonical it names are
  identity lines the refresh writes;
  **`--publishes organisation-units`** scaffolds a package rather than a guide
  (`kind = "package"` plus `publishes = "organisation-units"` under `[ig]`, the
  organisation-unit registry alone, a Home / Registry / Artifacts menu,
  `path-resource` limited to `registry/`) - the two keys are apart so a second
  sort of package is a new `publishes` value, not a new project kind; **`--registry-id`**
  / **`--registry-canonical`** / **`--registry-version`** / **`--registry-path`**
  name the registry package a guide depends on, seeding the
  `[generate.organisation_units.registry]` table, the `dependencies:` entry of
  `sushi-config.yaml` (uri `<canonical>/ImplementationGuide/<id>`) and the
  Makefile's `REGISTRY_ID` / `REGISTRY_VERSION` / `REGISTRY_TGZ` knobs - a
  half-named registry and a registry package naming one are refused;
  **`--sushi-timeout`** sets the `[FSH] timeout` of `ig/fsh.ini`, the ceiling
  the IG publisher gives its internal SUSHI run - an IG whose FSH overruns it
  fails the build with exit 143.
- **`--refresh`** brings an existing project's scaffold-managed files up to
  date, recovering the IG identity from the project's own `fhir.toml`,
  `ig/fsh.ini`, and `ig/sushi-config.yaml`. The `Makefile`, the `Dockerfile`,
  `.python-version`, `ig/ig.ini` and `ig/fsh.ini` are the scaffold's own files,
  rewritten whole from the current render whenever it differs, and reported
  `rewritten (scaffold-owned)` - their own verdict, because `refreshed` is the
  rewrite that keeps every line on disk. An edit to one of those five does not
  survive: the flag's help names them, the scaffolded Makefile's own header says
  so, and the report's note says where a value of your own belongs instead -
  every knob the Makefile has is a `?=` default set on the command line
  (`make build JAVA_HEAP=8g`) or in the environment, which is outside the file.
  The Makefile is owned by that name at a project root and at the root of a
  directory scaffolded with `--with-registry`. Every other file is rewritten
  only when the current render reproduces every line already on disk in order,
  so a refresh adds what the scaffold gained (a new `path-resource` glob, a new
  `.gitignore` entry, a new menu entry) and never drops a line the user wrote.
  Each file is reported as created / rewritten (scaffold-owned) / refreshed /
  refreshed, with your additions / unchanged / with your additions / diverged
  (kept), in the summary table and in the file list below it in the same words -
  the last two both keep the file byte-identical, and `diverged` names no author,
  because a line the user wrote and a scaffold line that has since changed read
  the same to a line-preserving refresh. `refreshed, with your additions` is
  both halves at once: an identity line landed on a file that also carries lines
  the render does not produce, so a title change and an appended section read as
  two facts rather than one. `fhir.toml` is never written; `--force` is rejected;
  any flag the refresh would ignore is refused.
  The accepted consequence is that a scaffold line deliberately deleted is
  restored, since a deletion leaves the file a subsequence of the render.
- **The refresh writes the scaffold lines `fhir.toml` declares.** Five files
  carry the guide's identity in every project - six where `--with-registry`
  scaffolded a pair - and one refresh lands an `[ig]` edit in all of them: `ig/sushi-config.yaml` (`id`, `canonical`, `name`, `title`, the
  description built from the title, `status`, the publisher name, and the six
  `special-url` lines the `[generate] identifier_system_base` stem addresses),
  the `[ig]` table of `fhir.example.toml`, the first-line heading of
  `ig/input/pagecontent/index.md`, the `ig = ` line of `ig/ig.ini`, the
  `[project] name` of `pyproject.toml`, and on a pair the heading of the root
  `README.md` plus the line naming the registry canonical. Each is reported
  refreshed, and `ig/ig.ini` rewritten, since the toolchain owns that one.
  Every other
  line of those files is the project's and survives byte-identical -
  `releaseLabel`, `version`, the publisher home page, `copyrightYear`, the
  parameters, the menu, the path-resource globs, the project's own prose and
  headings, an option it uncommented in the example. Until the refresh runs,
  `d2w fhir generate` raises a `scaffold-drift` note naming the keys `fhir.toml`
  and `ig/sushi-config.yaml` state differently.

### Build and publish

- **The scaffolded Makefile.** `make refresh` chains clean, upgrade,
  generate, a non-fatal validate, and build, keeping the caches. `make update` re-runs the
  scaffold refresh. `make serve` / `make serve-live` read the `[serve]` table
  and serve the capture UI at `/`; `make forward` / `make forward-import` drive
  the drain.
  `make check` is the artifact scan below, and `make build` runs it first.
- **`make build` builds on the container's own disk.** Docker on macOS reaches a
  mounted host directory over a network-style filesystem, and the publisher's
  output phase writes tens of thousands of small files one at a time - 341
  seconds through the mount against 21 on the container's disk, measured on one
  guide. The target streams the project in, builds there, and streams `output/`,
  `fsh-generated/` and `input-cache/` back; `temp/` and `template/` stay behind,
  since nothing reads them and they are the bulk of what a build writes.
  `make build-bind` runs the publisher straight over the mount for anyone who
  wants to watch `output/` fill as it is written.
- **`d2w fhir check-artifacts` refuses a doomed build in seconds.** The
  generate-time gate stands at the emit site, and a build never visits it:
  `make build` publishes whatever `ig/fsh-generated/` and `ig/input/` hold, so
  artifacts written before the gate existed, artifacts from an older toolchain
  pin, and hand-authored FSH all reach the publisher without passing it. The
  command applies the same refusal to those files - `ig/fsh-generated/**/*.json`,
  `ig/input/resources/**/*.json`, and `ig/input/fsh/**/*.fsh` - reading `name`,
  `title`, `display`, `text`, and `identifier[].value` through the shared
  `build_aborting_name` / `build_aborting_code` predicates rather than a second
  copy of the rule. Each finding names the file, the resource, the element, the
  value, and the one line that answers it. It opens no connection and reads no
  profile, exits 1 on a build-aborting finding, and takes `--no-fail`, `--json`,
  and an optional project directory. `ig/input/pagecontent/**/*.md` is out of
  that scan on purpose: markdown carries HTML by design. One line of it answers a
  different question - a page carrying the generated header is how the selection
  check knows the run it is reading finished. An existing project takes the gate
  up with one `d2w fhir init --refresh`.
- **The findings table reads at 80 columns**, which is what a CI log gets and
  `make build` runs this command into one. The file path is cut from the front,
  so what survives is the end that names the file; the resource and the element
  are dropped in that order when the terminal is too narrow for them, both being
  in `--json`. The remedy is not a column at all: six sentences stand behind
  every finding the scan raises, so they are printed under the table once each
  and whole - which is also the only place the `[generate.*]` table names inside
  one survive a narrow screen.
- **The scan reads the guide's own identity too**, in `fhir.toml`'s `[ig]` table
  and in `ig/sushi-config.yaml` (`title`, `name`, `publisher`, `description`).
  No DHIS2 selection supplies those, and no compiled resource carries them until
  SUSHI has run, so a project that has only generated has nowhere else on disk
  for a title carrying a `<` to be found - and the publisher dies on it in the
  same last pass. One identity stated in both files is one finding, named at
  `fhir.toml`, which is where a refresh writes the other from.
- **Each finding carries its origin, and the remedy follows from it.** A value
  from DHIS2 asks for a rename there or a narrower selection followed by
  `d2w fhir generate`; a value from `[ig]` asks for that key in `fhir.toml` and
  a `d2w fhir init --refresh`; a hand-authored source asks for an edit, because
  nothing regenerates one. The origin is modelled on `ArtifactFinding`, so the
  line a reader is given never guesses at where the string came from.
- **A form nobody can submit is a warning rather than a refusal.** A published
  Questionnaire whose organisation-unit assignment List names no unit the project
  publishes is reported once per form, with `max_level` named as what usually
  narrows the registry. The build is valid and would publish, so the command
  still exits 0; what it costs is the form, and the scan says so instead of
  letting a guide full of unusable forms read as clean.
- **`JAVA_HEAP`** is the publisher's JVM heap ceiling, derived from the memory
  docker reports less 6 GB - the JVM's own memory and Jekyll's - capped at
  `8g` because the JVM grows into a larger ceiling without needing it, floored
  at `4g`, falling back to `8g` when docker cannot be asked, and stated on
  every build. Each build ends by printing two peaks: the memory in use (the
  heap, the JVM and Jekyll, sampled inside the container) and the container's
  `memory.peak`, which also counts reclaimable file cache. The daemon is asked once per build, on
  first use, so `help`, `clean` and `generate` never wake it and every line of
  a build quotes one answer. A value set on the command line or in the
  environment is taken as it stands and asks docker nothing; an empty one
  derives exactly as an unset one does. It is a ceiling, not a reservation.
- **Exit 137 is diagnosed, not asserted.** The container reads its own cgroup's
  `oom_kill` count as it exits and prints it beside the peak it reached, so
  `build` and `build-bind` report a kernel out-of-memory kill in full - the
  ceiling, the memory docker reports, the peak, the containers running when it
  was sampled, and the ways out, numbered so the stop-the-containers step
  appears only when there are containers to stop - and name the opposite
  failure, an `OutOfMemoryError`, so the two are not confused. A 137 the cgroup
  did not count as an out-of-memory kill - a `docker stop`, a `docker kill`, a
  timeout around the build - gets a shorter message saying exactly that.
- **`make registry-install`** in a guide that depends on a registry package
  streams the package's `package.tgz` (`REGISTRY_TGZ`, defaulting to
  `<registry.path>/ig/output/package.tgz`) into the shared package-cache volume
  under `<id>#<version>/package/`; `sushi`, `build` and `build-bind` depend on
  it. `make registry-present` runs ahead of all of them and of the volume they
  share: an archive that is not there is two `test` calls and a refusal, so a
  compile that cannot finish creates no docker volume on its way to failing. The
  refusal names the registry's own `make build`, and says that
  `d2w fhir serve --live` and `d2w fhir forward` read the two projects as they
  stand and need no build of either. The registry project builds in its own container, so neither build
  carries the other's resources; one `JAVA_HEAP` on the root Makefile reaches
  both through make's own variable propagation, and each project derives its
  own ceiling when none is set.
- **Registry scale.** `d2w fhir generate org-units` warns at generate time once
  the registry passes 2,000 instances, because the IG publisher validates and
  renders every resource and the registry therefore sets the wall clock of
  `make build`. The warning names the `[generate.organisation_units]`
  `max_level` / `root` dials.
- **A code or name carrying `<` refuses the run.** `d2w fhir generate` refuses
  a run whose emitted code or byte-true name carries `<`, through the same
  predicates `fhir validate` grades with, naming the resource type, UID, name,
  and code - because the IG publisher writes identifier values and titles into
  pages it strict-parses after writing, and aborts its final pass on the
  malformed page after every resource has been rendered. The whole run is
  refused rather than the object skipped, since skipping leaves every
  Questionnaire binding it pointing at a ValueSet nobody wrote.
- **The name gate covers every kind of object a selection publishes**: option
  sets and their options, categories and their category options, organisation
  units, data sets, event programs, tracker programs and their stages, tracked
  entity types, and the data elements and tracked entity attributes those forms
  ask as questions - a question's name is its data-dictionary concept display and
  its label wherever DHIS2 writes no form name, and its form name is that label
  wherever DHIS2 writes one; the gate reads both spellings, byte-true DHIS2 data
  either way, and the refusal says which of the two to change. Every target that
  writes a form's name reads the same gate, so `generate pages` and `generate examples` refuse
  exactly what `generate questionnaires` refuses. The parity with
  `fhir validate` runs both ways: a validate error on the build path is a
  generate refusal, and a generate refusal is a validate error on the build
  path. Only codes stay asymmetric, and deliberately - a question object's code
  becomes a concept property the publisher escapes rather than an identifier
  value it does not.
- **Or the guide publishes the name in wording the build survives.** Refusing is
  one answer and often the wrong one: DHIS2 names carry `<` legitimately, and an
  age band called `5 to < 15 years, Female` is not a defect to be renamed in a
  production instance. `--substitute-hostile-names` publishes it as `5 to under
  15 years, Female` (`<=` reads as `at most`); `--refuse-hostile-names` keeps
  today's refusal; `[generate] hostile_names = "refuse" | "substitute"` is the
  project's standing answer; and with none of them a run holding a terminal
  prints the count, up to ten `before -> after` samples, and asks, while a run
  with no terminal names the two flags and rewrites nothing rather than hanging a
  script on a prompt. A flag beats the dial, the dial beats the question. DHIS2 is
  never written to and no UID is rewritten, so the ConceptMaps still take a
  published concept back to its DHIS2 object, and a code carrying `<` refuses the
  run under either answer. The rewrite lands where DHIS2 metadata enters the
  emission inputs, before a single identity, stem, or decomposition is planned off
  a name, so every target inherits one spelling - which is also how it covers the
  class no refusal reaches: a category option combo name, which becomes a cell's
  label and a data dictionary concept display (one national selection generated
  cleanly and handed the publisher 738 of them). Every rewrite is a
  `name-substitution` note, one per distinct DHIS2 name.
- **The substitute posture rewrites every code carrying a `<`.** A code becomes an
  identifier value the publisher writes into a table cell unescaped and then
  strict-parses, so a `<` in it aborts the build's last pass. Under `substitute`
  its comparison is reworded the way a name's is and then every space is
  hyphenated (`ENTO - IRS < 6 Months` publishes as `ENTO---IRS-under-6-Months`),
  with the DHIS2 code stated as the `dhis2-code` property exactly as for a spaced
  code. Under `refuse` the run is refused, naming the object.
- **The substitute posture hyphenates every code carrying a space.** An R4 `code`
  admits single internal spaces, so `Pre eclampsia` is legal FHIR and nothing
  refuses it - and the publisher's anchor slug strips the whitespace, so it and a
  literal `Preeclampsia` render one anchor id (BUGS.md 107), while every URL, CQL
  quotation, and terminology server below the guide handles the space at its own
  discretion. Under `substitute` each space becomes a hyphen, everywhere the guide
  publishes a DHIS2 code: the option-set, category, and category-option-combo
  vocabularies under `concept_code_source = "code"`, the `.../id/*-code`
  identifier CodeSystems the ConceptMaps target, the ConceptMap rows themselves,
  and the identifier values that name the same namespaces - so the published
  vocabulary is self-consistent. Two codes that would land on one published code
  are separated by an ordinal suffix (`Pre-eclampsia-2`), assigned in sorted order
  so the same selection publishes the same codes every run. Every rewritten
  concept states the DHIS2 code byte-true as a `dhis2-code` property, which is
  what the capture path reads: a QuestionnaireResponse answering with the
  published code lowers to the DHIS2 code on the import payload. Under `refuse`
  and unset, every code reaches the guide byte-true. Every rewrite is a
  `code-substitution` note, one per distinct DHIS2 code. Names holding a
  comparison are rewritten as wording - `<` reads "under", `>` reads "over",
  both the character and the HTML entity spelling a DHIS2 instance can store -
  with the same rewrite applied to NAME translations, and the instance's byte-true
  spelling stated as a `dhis2-name` property beside the published display; every
  such rewrite is a `name-substitution` note.
- **A rewritten option set states both DHIS2 spellings as defined extensions.** A
  concept hangs its instance spelling on a concept property, and an option set's
  own CodeSystem and ValueSet have no concept to hang one on - so each carries the
  DHIS2 code under `D2OriginalCode` and the DHIS2 name under `D2OriginalName`,
  two `string` extensions the `foundation` target defines and contexts on
  `CodeSystem` and `ValueSet`. A resource the run published byte-true carries
  neither.

### Generate the IG source

`d2w fhir generate` runs all seven targets in one go, off a single pass over
the instance - 8 requests where the solo targets total 25 - reported as one
summary row per target. Notes go to `reports/fhir-generate-notes.md` with one
counted hint on the terminal, counting the kinds that only restate a `validate`
finding apart; `--details` prints them inline.

- **Every target says what it covers and what that cost in files.** The row
  carries a `Subject` column - `1,332 organisation units`, `13 option sets`,
  `14 questionnaires` - beside `Files written`, `Files unchanged`, and
  `Files deleted`, and the step line leads with the same subject
  (`[7/8] organisation units: 1,332 organisation units, 2,667 files written,
  0 files unchanged`). The two numbers differ wherever one covered object ships
  as several resources: an organisation unit becomes both an `Organization` and
  a `Location`. The foundation target covers no instance object, so it reports
  files alone, and the closing `full pipeline:` line is a file count.

- **A run that rewrites FSH removes the compile it no longer matches.** Any
  target that writes or sweeps a file under `ig/input/fsh/` removes
  `ig/fsh-generated/` - SUSHI's output and nobody else's, which
  `d2w fhir check-artifacts`, `d2w fhir serve`, `d2w fhir forward`, and
  `make build` all read - so the tree on disk is never new sources beside an old
  compile. One `compile-removed` note per run names the directory and
  `make sushi`; the target that writes only predefined JSON leaves the compile
  alone, an unchanged regenerate leaves it alone, and `ig/temp/` (the
  publisher's scratch) and `ig/output/` (a published site) are never touched.

- **A compile that stops on an error leaves nothing to serve.** SUSHI keeps
  whatever it had written when it stopped, and that half reads as a finished
  guide to everything downstream, so `make sushi` removes
  `ig/fsh-generated/` when SUSHI exits non-zero, says so, and hands SUSHI's own
  status back to make. The presence of that directory therefore means one thing:
  a compile that finished. `d2w fhir serve` then meets a project with no
  compiled guide and refuses by naming `d2w fhir generate` and `make sushi`,
  rather than publishing a partial one.

#### Targets and selection

- **Four target tables** select what is published:
  `[generate.data_sets]`, `[generate.event_programs]` (WITHOUT_REGISTRATION),
  `[generate.tracker_programs]` (WITH_REGISTRATION), and
  `[generate.tracked_entity_forms]`.
- **`[generate.tracked_entity_forms]`** names the tracked entity types that
  publish a person-only registration form under `fsh/tracked-entity-types/`
  (`D2TET_<type>`, form kind `tracked-entity`): the attributes the type itself
  collects, every item at the entity level, no enrollment, no organisation-unit
  assignment, answered against `D2TrackedEntityResponse` and forwarded as a
  bare `/api/tracker` `trackedEntities` entry.
- **Absent or empty means all** of that kind for the first three tables, and
  the types the selected tracker programs register for the fourth; a non-empty
  list filters.
- **`enabled = false`** on any of the four tables publishes no form of that
  kind and costs no request for one; `include_ids` is kept and ignored, so the
  selection returns when the table is switched back on. A guide about programs
  alone switches `[generate.data_sets]` off rather than listing a UID that
  matches nothing.
- **The whole-instance sweep** routes every program by its live `programType`
  and collects the types neither table maps into one aggregate note. A program
  listed under the table its type does not belong to is a loud failure by name,
  pointing at the table that does select it.

#### Foundation: identifiers and extensions

The `foundation` target emits the DHIS2 identifier aliases and the
NamingSystems declaring them, plus these extensions:

- **The identifier stem is a label, not an address.** Every system is
  `[generate] identifier_system_base` plus a path, `http://dhis2.org/fhir` by
  default, and nothing is published at that domain: the guide's own
  NamingSystems are what a consumer resolves. A project sets a stem under a
  domain it controls before its first real publish, and the six `special-url`
  lines of `ig/sushi-config.yaml` follow it on refresh.
- **`D2Period`** - contexted on QuestionnaireResponse and MeasureReport, with
  its period-type CodeSystem/ValueSet over all 23 DHIS2 period types, matched
  by a `parse_period` ISO parser and its `recent_periods` inverse.
- **`D2PeriodType`** - contexted on Questionnaire and bound to that same
  ValueSet: the reporting frequency an aggregate form's responses have to
  report under, so a client resolves the ISO period format off the form rather
  than off an example.
- **`D2DateLabels`** - contexted on Questionnaire, one `valueString` slice per
  date the instance labels (`enrollmentDate` and `incidentDate` off a tracker
  program, `eventDate` off a program stage or an event program's stage), each
  slice present only where DHIS2 states a label and each carrying its own
  translations.
- **`D2Repeatable`** - contexted on Questionnaire, valued boolean: whether one
  enrollment may capture a tracker program stage more than once, declared
  either way on every stage form.
- **`D2Description`** - contexted on `Questionnaire.item`, valued string: the
  DHIS2 free text about the data element, tracked entity attribute, or section
  a question or group is asked from.
- **`D2OriginalName`** and **`D2OriginalCode`** - contexted on CodeSystem and
  ValueSet, valued string: the name and the code the DHIS2 instance holds for the
  object a resource publishes, stated wherever the run published either rewritten
  under `hostile_names = "substitute"`.
- **`D2FormType`** - contexted on Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse
  alike.
- **`D2ProgramRule`** - a repeating complex extension carrying, per rule the
  form does not itself express, the DHIS2 rule UID (`valueId`), its name and
  free text with their translations, the expression the server evaluates
  character for character, what the rule does, coded from the
  `D2ProgramRuleAction` CodeSystem/ValueSet pair over every
  `programRuleActionType` v41, v42, and v43 declare, and - on an `ASSIGN` rule -
  one `assigns` sub-extension per question the rule computes the answer to,
  valued with that question's `linkId`.
- **`D2OrganisationUnitAssignment`** - contexted on Questionnaire, valued
  `Reference(List)`: the organisation units a form may be captured against.
- **`D2AttributeOptionCombos`** (Questionnaire, `canonical(ValueSet)`) paired
  with **`D2AttributeOptionCombo`** (QuestionnaireResponse, `Coding`) - the key
  a submission is filed under: the third key of a DHIS2 data value set,
  `(orgUnit, period, attributeOptionCombo)`, and the `attributeOptionCombo` of
  the event or enrollment a program response creates. A data set declares its
  own category combo's option combos; every form of a program declares the
  program's, because DHIS2 answers `E1055` to an event of a program whose
  category combo is not the default one and which was filed under the default.
- **`D2OrganisationUnitLevel`** - contexted on Location, valued `Coding` and
  bound extensibly to the organisation-unit level ValueSet: the hierarchy level
  a published place sits at, stated on the Location because that is the
  hierarchy-bearing half of the pair, while the Organization already carries
  the same coding as `Organization.type`. Both read one coding, whose display
  is the instance's own name for that depth and whose code is `level-<n>`.
- **`D2AttributeValue`** - contexted on Organization, Location, CodeSystem,
  ValueSet, and Questionnaire.
- **`D2TrackedEntityAttributeValue`** - contexted on Patient.

#### Program rules

- **Two tiers are expressed in core FHIR and carry no extension of their own.**
  A `SHOWERROR` refusing a number outside a range becomes the core `minValue` /
  `maxValue` on the question it tests, narrowing whatever the DHIS2 value type
  already stated. A `HIDEFIELD` on one other question's answer becomes core
  `item.enableWhen` with the operator negated, plus - where DHIS2 would show
  the question before anything is answered - an `exists` arm under
  `enableBehavior = #any`.
- **A hide on a coded answer names the concept code the bound set publishes**,
  which follows `concept_code_source` - the option UID under `id`, the option
  code under `code`, hyphenated where the substitute posture rewrote it. A
  literal no option of the set carries is published whole on `D2ProgramRule`
  instead, with a note naming the rule, the question, and the literal.
- **A deliberately conservative grammar** reads the conditions: one comparison
  between one `#{variable}` and one literal, optionally `d2:hasValue`-guarded
  on that same variable, with the variable resolved through
  `programRuleVariables` to a question the same form asks.
- **Every rule it cannot read whole is published whole instead** on
  `D2ProgramRule`, never half-translated.
- **A rule whose action is `ASSIGN` is published with the questions it
  computes, and every emitter leaves those questions empty.** The rule's
  `assigns` sub-extensions name each question DHIS2 calculates the answer to, so
  a client can join the rule to the item on its own form; the question itself
  carries no marking, because the fact belongs to the rule. The examples target
  and `d2w fhir generate load-set` answer none of them, and `d2w fhir generate`
  raises a note per form naming the rules and the questions, then closes the run
  with a line naming how many published forms ask such a question and how many
  questions across them, because a form whose corpus answers nine of thirteen
  questions on purpose is otherwise a progress counter a reader cannot read.
  DHIS2 refuses a payload whose answer is neither empty nor byte-equal to the
  value it calculated (`E1307`), and a calculated value can be one no answer
  expresses at all, so no answer is the only answer that always lands. `d2w fhir
  check-artifacts` files a warning-level finding for a published example that
  answers one, in both formats an example lives in - the compiled JSON, and the
  FSH source it was compiled from, which is the only place a hand-authored
  example sits and the only half of the tree a project holds before `make build`
  runs SUSHI. The forms are read in both formats for the same reason: before a
  compile, the questions a rule computes are on the FSH Questionnaire's own
  `assigns` slice, which is where the scan reads them. The capture UI renders
  such a question read-only, naming the
  rule, out of the progress count and out of the submission.

#### Organisation-unit assignment

- Published as one R4 `List` of Locations per form under
  `ig/input/resources/assignments/`, and only when the DHIS2 assignment is a
  proper subset of the published registry: assigned everywhere publishes
  nothing, and absence means the whole registry.
- Tracker stages share their program's `List`, because DHIS2 hangs the
  assignment on the program - one `List` across the registration form and every
  stage.
- `List` rather than `Group` because R4 admits no Location as a
  `Group.member.entity`.
- **A run that published forms nobody may report says so on its own line.** When
  an assignment intersects the published registry at nothing, `d2w fhir generate`
  closes with a warning naming how many published forms carry an empty
  assignment and the `[generate.organisation_units] max_level` in force, then
  names both selections in one sentence: widen the organisation-unit selection,
  or narrow the form selection. `d2w fhir check-artifacts` answers its own
  finding with that identical sentence. Forms are the unit counted - a tracker
  program's stages each publish a Questionnaire and share one `List` - so the
  run, the facade's 422, and `d2w fhir check-artifacts` all state one number, and
  the line names the data sets and programs the assignment hangs on. A national
  instance raises several hundred terminology notes per run, which is why this is
  a line of its own rather than one of them.
- **A run that published forms no organisation unit may file a capture for says
  so on its own line too.** DHIS2 scopes a category option to organisation units
  on top of the assignment and refuses a capture keyed to a combo not usable at
  the organisation unit it was filed from (`E8025`), so a form whose whole combo
  vocabulary is scoped away from every organisation unit that may report it is a
  form nobody can submit. The run already wrote the restriction `List`s that
  prove it, so `d2w fhir generate` closes with a warning naming the forms and the
  `max_level` in force, and names both dials in one sentence: widen the
  organisation-unit selection until one of the restricted organisation units is
  published, or narrow the form selection. `d2w fhir check-artifacts` answers its
  own warning-level finding with that identical sentence, read off the published
  `List`s with no connection.
- **A run that published forms DHIS2 has closed every combo of says so on its
  own line too.** The date axis's answer to the one above: DHIS2 scopes a
  category option to a calendar window and refuses a capture the window does not
  cover entirely (`E8032`), so a form whose every declared combo closed before
  the period it reports now - the newest completed period of its own period type,
  and every later one - is a form nobody can submit. `d2w fhir generate` closes
  with a warning naming the forms, and its remedy says plainly where the fix is:
  a category option's `startDate` / `endDate` is DHIS2 metadata and no fhir.toml
  setting widens it, so the options are reopened in DHIS2 or the form selection
  is narrowed. `d2w fhir check-artifacts` answers its own warning-level finding
  with that identical sentence, read off the windows the vocabulary publishes and
  the period type the Questionnaire declares, with no connection.
- **A selection entry that matched nothing says so on its own line too.** A
  `[generate.*] include_ids` UID the instance answers nothing for costs the
  guide a whole form, its examples and its page, so `d2w fhir generate` closes
  with a warning per family naming every unmatched UID, and a family none of
  whose entries matched says outright that the run publishes nothing of that
  kind. `d2w fhir check-artifacts` reports the same entry as a warning-level
  finding against `fhir.toml`, read off the published tree with no connection.
  An `include_ids` that is absent or an empty list selects everything, which is
  why `enabled = false` is the switch that publishes none. The scan grades a
  selection only against a tree a run finished writing: a refused run writes the
  foundation target and stops, and reading a selection off that half-written tree
  would say a UID live on the instance - the very object the run refused over -
  is not on it. The pages are the evidence the run reached the end - they narrate
  what every other target wrote, so a run writes them last, and one page carrying
  the generated header is a tree every entry may be read off. Without one the
  scan says the run did not complete and grades nothing.
- `d2w fhir serve` grades the subject, the tracker organisation-unit extension,
  and every ORGANISATION_UNIT answer against it, on the same lenient/strict
  dial coded answers take, and `$generate` draws its Location from it. The
  finding names the code that kind's import really answers: the two halves of
  DHIS2 grade one fact under two names, `E8022 Data set ... not usable with org
  unit(s)` on an aggregate import and `E1029` on a tracker or event one.
- **A form publishing no assignment is graded against the served registry.**
  "Assigned everywhere" is every organisation unit this server publishes, not
  every string shaped like a reference, so a unit the registry does not hold
  takes the same dial - a warning on the receipt, a refusal under
  `--strict-codes` - naming the `E1011` or `E1049` DHIS2 answers a capture filed
  at a unit it does not hold. The guide's own worked exemplar is refused whatever
  the dial says: it illustrates the organisation-unit profile and stands for no
  place on any instance. A project publishing no registry at all states no set to
  check against, and the reference's shape is all that is graded.

#### Attribute option combos

- One CodeSystem/ValueSet pair per distinct non-default attribute category
  combo under `ig/input/resources/attribute-option-combos/`, on the `AOC`
  naming token - deliberately not the data dictionary's `COC`, which codes a
  question's disaggregation cells rather than the combo the whole response is
  filed under. One pair is shared by every data set on that combo.
- A ConceptMap per pair takes each concept back to
  `<base>/id/category-option-combo` and its `-code` sibling.
- One `Coding`-valued concept property per category the combo splits over,
  declared `category-<stem>` with the category's name as its description and
  valued into that category's own published `d2-cat-<stem>-cs` CodeSystem, in
  the category combo's own order, on the same concept-code assignment the
  category pair builds its concepts from. Carried on the `D2COC_CS`
  disaggregation vocabulary as well as on every `D2AOC` pair, so a reader
  holding "Fixed, <1y" can dig into the Fixed and the <1y it was met from.
- **One `List` per organisation-unit-restricted category option**, named from
  every combo concept met from it by a repeating `dhis2-organisation-units`
  concept property valued `List/<id>`. DHIS2 scopes a category option to
  organisation units and refuses a value keyed to a combo not usable at the unit
  it was filed from (`E8025`), so the vocabulary publishes the scope: the List
  holds the units of this project's registry that sit at or under one of the
  restricted units, which settles DHIS2's descendant rule once at generate time.
  An option every published unit already sits under narrows nothing and
  publishes nothing; an option none of them sits under publishes an empty List,
  which is the vocabulary saying the combo is usable nowhere here. The read is
  scoped to the category options of the non-default attribute combos the
  selection rides and carries the published units' `path` on the registry read
  the run already makes, so it costs one extra request and no hierarchy walk.
- **A validity window on every combo concept whose category options state one**,
  as a `dhis2-valid-from` / `dhis2-valid-to` pair of `dateTime` concept
  properties. DHIS2 scopes a category option by calendar window as well as by
  organisation unit and refuses a data value set whose period the window does not
  cover with `E8032 Untimely data entry`, so the vocabulary publishes the window
  the way it publishes the restriction - on the concept itself, a window being
  two dates rather than thousands of organisation units. What a concept carries
  is the narrowest window of the options it is met from, the latest start and the
  earliest end, which is DHIS2's own `CategoryOptionCombo` date range; an option
  stating neither date publishes nothing, and absence means always open. The
  dates ride the same `categoryOptions` read the organisation-unit restriction
  does, so the date axis costs no request of its own.
- A category outside `[generate.categories]` drops its axis with a
  selection-gap note rather than coding into a CodeSystem nobody wrote.
- Nothing at all for a default-combo data set, because absence means the
  default combo. Publishing the combo is what un-skips a non-default data set
  in `generate load-set` and lets a third party construct a complete aggregate
  capture from the guide alone.

#### DHIS2 attribute values

- **`D2AttributeValue`** is a complex extension of `attributeId` (1..1),
  `attributeCode` (0..1, absent because DHIS2 leaves most attributes uncoded)
  and `value` (1..1, a string whatever the attribute's declared valueType),
  carrying a DHIS2 `attributeValues` entry onto every generated resource that
  can hold one.
- The attribute code is joined from a `/api/attributes` read resolved unpaged
  once per generate run, because DHIS2 pages that endpoint 50 at a time.
- The same read carries `unique`: a value of an attribute DHIS2 declares unique
  names its object rather than annotating it, so those values leave the
  extension and join the resource's `identifier` list, after the UID and code
  slices so the order stays byte-stable, under
  `{base}/attribute/{attributeUid}` - keyed on the UID because a DHIS2
  attribute code may hold spaces and a system URI may not.
- The per-attribute namespaces are declared by convention rather than as
  NamingSystems, since the foundation layer is built from `fhir.toml` alone and
  cannot know which attributes an instance has.
- **`D2TrackedEntityAttributeValue`** carries the same three sub-extensions for
  the other DHIS2 key-value family - a tracked entity attribute being a
  different object from a metadata attribute, and one extension claiming both
  would publish a definition false of half its instances. Same
  unique-becomes-an-identifier rule under
  `{base}/tracked-entity-attribute/{attributeUid}`, with the flag read off the
  `unique` property `D2TEA_CS` already publishes. This is what
  `d2w fhir serve --live` projects a person onto.

#### The capture contract

- **Five response profiles on QuestionnaireResponse**, one per form kind:
  `D2AggregateResponse`, `D2EventResponse`, `D2TrackerRegistrationResponse`,
  `D2TrackerEventResponse`, and `D2TrackedEntityResponse`. Each pins the
  extensions, `questionnaire`, `subject`, and - per kind - the mandatory
  `D2Period` or `authored` a captured response has to carry, with
  `D2FormType.valueCode` fixed to the kind's own code.
- **The aggregate profile and the three program profiles** additionally slice
  `D2AttributeOptionCombo` 0..1 and state in prose that a response answering a
  form which declares a `D2AttributeOptionCombos` vocabulary has to carry it -
  requiredness is a fact about the form, not the kind, so it cannot be a
  cardinality. The person-only profile slices none: a tracked entity type
  belongs to no program and is filed under no combo.
- **The registration profile** additionally slices `D2SubjectExists` 0..1: the
  boolean stating that the person the response is subject to is already held by
  the instance, so the response enrols them rather than creating them.
  `d2w fhir forward` imports that as a top-level `enrollments` array naming
  that tracked entity under plain `CREATE` rather than a `trackedEntities`
  wrapper whose `CREATE_AND_UPDATE` would rewrite the person's owning
  organisation unit (BUGS.md 73), carries the program's own attributes on the
  enrollment because DHIS2 answers `E1018` when they ride nothing, and refuses
  the whole response with `entity-level-answer-on-existing-subject` where it
  answers a question of the person's own record - an enrollment-only import has
  nowhere to put it, and a silently dropped answer is a captured value that
  reaches no instance.
- **Subject typing.** The aggregate and event profiles restrict
  `subject only Reference(D2Location)`. The three tracked-entity profiles
  (registration, tracker-event, and the person-only one) restrict it to
  `Reference(Patient)` plus every other resource type
  `[generate.tracked_entity_types]` names, so the published union is as tight
  as the project is.
- **The subject is a logical reference**: no `reference` element,
  `subject.identifier` 1..1 with its system fixed to
  `{base}/id/tracked-entity`, because the guide publishes no Patient instances
  and the tracked entity resolves against DHIS2.
- **Two extensions instead** on the tracker-event profile: `D2TrackerEnrollment`
  1..1 carrying the enrollment UID as a valueIdentifier under
  `{base}/id/tracker-enrollment`, and `D2OrganisationUnit` 1..1 carrying the
  capture unit as a valueReference to its published Location.
- **The tracker registration profile** keys the same way and adds the two dates
  a DHIS2 enrollment holds: `D2EnrolledAt` 1..1 and `D2IncidentAt` 0..1, the
  second only because a program states whether it collects an incident date at
  all and the registration Questionnaire publishes that statement on the
  `D2CollectsIncidentDate` extension, so both stores read one declared fact.
- **A registration response mints both identities it names**, as
  client-generated DHIS2 UIDs, since it is the document that creates them -
  which is what lets a client enrol a person and capture the enrollment's first
  stage events in one breath. The registration form ships identifier-keyed,
  deferring roadmap decision 5.2; no Patient, EpisodeOfCare, or CarePlan
  resource is published.
- **`D2CaptureServer` CapabilityStatement** declares one `create` per
  QuestionnaireResponse against all five profiles a server captures.
  `CAPTURED_FORM_KINDS` is the single tuple serve's capture index, the
  conversion gate, the `supportedProfile` declarations, `/metadata`, and the
  load set all key off, so the statement can never claim an interaction the
  facade does not perform. It also declares read and search over the
  Questionnaire, CodeSystem, ValueSet, Location, and Organization resources a
  client resolves a form from.
- **`D2GenerateOperation` OperationDefinition** stands behind `$generate`:
  `kind #operation`, `code #generate`, `resource #Questionnaire`,
  `instance = true` with `system`/`type` false, `affectsState = false` so a GET
  is legal, one optional `integer` `seed` input, one optional `string` `subject`
  input naming an organisation unit as `Location/<id>`, and a
  `QuestionnaireResponse` `return`, plus a `comment` stating outright that it is
  not SDC's `$populate`.
  It is deliberately absent from the `kind #requirements` capture statement,
  because a server that only receives captures is still conformant.

#### The conversion contract

Published as two FHIR-native artifacts:

- **`D2DataValueSet`** - the `/api/dataValueSets` envelope as a `kind = logical`
  StructureDefinition: the three keys DHIS2 stores a data value under required,
  the attribute option combo and the completeness date optional, one repeating
  data value carrying its data element, its category option combo, and the
  string every DHIS2 value is on the wire.
- **`D2AggregateResponseToDataValueSet`** - the StructureMap from an aggregate
  QuestionnaireResponse onto it in two groups: the envelope, then a recursive
  walk of the item tree splitting `<dataElement>.<categoryOptionCombo>` out of
  each answered link id. Authored as an `Instance:` of StructureMap because
  SUSHI compiles no FHIR Mapping Language.
- **The rules whose meaning exceeds what a transform states** carry that on
  their own `documentation`: the data set is the form's identifier rather than
  the response's, the organisation unit needs the Location registry resolved,
  the attribute option combo is a ConceptMap translation under code-mode
  naming, and the wire value is the whole serialisation table.
- **One value rule per answered `value[x]` type**, each naming its type on
  `source.type` and reading its own variable, because the publisher's validator
  types an expression over the whole choice as no primitive.
- **Gated in CI** by `test_fhir_conversion_contract.py`, which reads the
  SUSHI-compiled model and holds every data value set the Python forwarder
  produces against its cardinalities and types - the model judging the
  implementation, never the reverse, and never executing the map.

#### Terminology

- **Option sets** become CodeSystem/ValueSet pairs carrying both DHIS2
  identifiers and the set's DHIS2 attribute values on both halves, shipped as
  pre-built R4 JSON under `ig/input/resources/terminology/`, one
  `CodeSystem-<id>.json` and one `ValueSet-<id>.json` per set. They are
  serialised from the `dhis2w_fhir.r4` models and loaded by SUSHI as predefined
  resources into `sushi-local#LOCAL` rather than compiled from FSH, each
  carrying the FSH-style `name` a questionnaire's `Canonical(...)` binding
  fishes them by.
- **Concept codes** are made unique in DHIS2 sort order; an option with no
  unique code left to take is skipped with its own note rather than emitted
  twice.
- **One ConceptMap per set** beside the pair under
  `ig/input/resources/concept-maps/` (`D2OS_<stem>_CM`, id sharing the pair's
  identity stem, `sourceCanonical` the set's own ValueSet), whose two groups
  take every emitted concept code back to the DHIS2 option UID under
  `{base}/id/option` and to the DHIS2 option code under `{base}/id/option-code`,
  `equivalence #equal` on every row because both name the same DHIS2 option.
  Built from the same concept assignment the concepts are, so a mapping can
  only name a concept the pair carries. The code group is emitted only where an
  option has a DHIS2 code that is a valid FHIR `code`, and there is no map at
  all for a set with no concepts.
- **DHIS2 categories** become the same CodeSystem/ValueSet pair built by the
  same concept assignment: one axis of a disaggregation and its category
  options as the concepts, in the category's own `categoryOptions` order, named
  by the `CAT` token (`D2CAT_Sex_CS` / `_VS`), carrying the category's DHIS2
  attribute values on both halves. Shipped as pre-built R4 JSON under
  `ig/input/resources/categories/` - its own directory, because a JSON sync
  deletes every unproduced file in its target and two targets sharing one would
  delete each other's documents - and declared by a third `path-resource` glob
  in the scaffolded `sushi-config.yaml`.
- **One ConceptMap per category** beside the option-set maps in
  `ig/input/resources/concept-maps/` (`D2CAT_<stem>_CM`, id sharing the
  category's identity stem, the category UID under `{base}/id/category` as its
  business identifier, `sourceCanonical` the category's own ValueSet), whose
  two groups take every emitted concept code back to the DHIS2 category-option
  UID under `{base}/id/category-option` and to the DHIS2 category-option code
  under `{base}/id/category-option-code`. Both namespaces are declared as
  NamingSystems and aliased (`$DHIS2-CO`, `$DHIS2-CO-CODE`) by the `foundation`
  target.
- **`D2Sex_CM`** is the first map this project publishes onto a vocabulary that
  is not DHIS2's own: one `equal` row per line of
  `[ips.identity.administrative_gender]`, sourced from the nominated attribute's
  own value namespace (`{base}/tracked-entity-attribute/{uid}` - the very system
  the register publishes that attribute's values under) and targeting
  `http://hl7.org/fhir/administrative-gender`. Written by the `questionnaires`
  target beside the attribute vocabulary it reads out of, rows sorted by the
  DHIS2 value so an unchanged `fhir.toml` regenerates the same bytes, and no file
  at all where no `sex` is nominated. The register reads the file rather than the
  map, because the nominations the map depends on are published nowhere; the map
  is what makes the translation auditable from the guide alone.
- **`D2Section_CM`** is the second such map: one `equal` row per DHIS2 object
  `[ips.sections]` nominates as feeding a section of an International Patient
  Summary, in two groups - the stages under `{base}/id/program-stage` and the
  dose data elements under `{base}/id/data-element`, both onto LOINC, both onto
  `11369-6` for the one section a mapping reaches. The sources are the DHIS2
  identifier namespaces rather than the generated concept codes, because a
  concept code moves with `[generate.naming] source` and a UID namespace never
  does. Written by the `questionnaires` target as
  `concept-maps/ConceptMap-d2-section-cm.json`, rows sorted by UID so an
  unchanged `fhir.toml` regenerates the same bytes, a namespace with no
  nomination getting no group rather than an empty one, and no file at all where
  no section is mapped. The server assembles a summary from the file and
  publishes the map for audit - the posture `D2Sex_CM` already has.
- **The one directory the map families share** states ownership by file-name
  prefix (`sync_json_artifacts(owned_prefix=...)`), so each family sweeps only
  the ids its own naming token produces (`ConceptMap-d2-os-`,
  `ConceptMap-d2-cat-`, `ConceptMap-d2-aoc-`, `ConceptMap-d2-sex`,
  `ConceptMap-d2-section`) and one `path-resource` glob covers them all.
- **Every identifier namespace a map targets is published as a CodeSystem too**,
  at the same URL, with `content: complete` and every identifier the guide's own
  maps name enumerated in it - `{base}/id/option` and `{base}/id/option-code`
  beside the option-set pairs, the two category-option namespaces beside the
  category pairs, the two option-combo namespaces beside the attribute-combo
  pairs. A NamingSystem states what a namespace is and lists nothing, so a
  ConceptMap row validated against one sent the IG publisher to a terminology
  server and came back UNKNOWN_CODESYSTEM: 4,779 requests on one district-scale
  guide, against 5 once the namespaces are enumerated, with the publisher's
  narrative phase down from 438 seconds to 1.5. The namespaces are read off the
  built maps rather than assumed, so a family that grows a mapping group cannot
  leave its new target system un-enumerated, and the scaffolded
  `sushi-config.yaml` declares all six under `special-url` because they sit
  outside the IG's own canonical. Each code is stated once per CodeSystem,
  whichever maps named it: two option sets legitimately share a `Preeclampsia`
  option code, and the publisher anchors a concept row by its code, so the same
  code twice is one anchor id on two rows - which its own QA pass reports as a
  duplicate anchor on the rendered page.
- **`[generate.categories]` `include_ids`** selects, where absent or empty
  meaning every category except DHIS2's built-in `default` placeholder. That
  placeholder exchanges no information, so `include_default = false` skips it
  unless the flag opts it back in or an `include_ids` entry names its UID
  outright; detection is the reserved rename-protected name matched
  case-sensitively, since `/api/categories` carries no `isDefault` flag.
  `d2w fhir validate` resolves its categories scope through the same rule.
- **There is deliberately no `category_option` naming token**, since category
  options are concepts inside their category's CodeSystem exactly as options
  are inside an option set's, and the `CO` name stays reserved for a future
  standalone artifact.

#### Questionnaires

Data sets, event programs, tracker program stages, and a tracker program's own
registration form become `Questionnaire` instances.

- **Structure.** Sections as `#group` items, data elements typed from their
  `valueType`, option-set-bound questions answered from the set's ValueSet,
  non-default category combos as per-option-combo child groups rendered
  `#gtable`.
- **The combo is resolved at one point**, `service._effective_category_combo`:
  the data set element's own `categoryCombo` where DHIS2 states one and the
  data element's where it does not - the disaggregation a data set really holds
  its cells over, and what every downstream reader of a cell follows.
- **Each cell asks the element's own question** - same item type, same
  `answerValueSet`, same `repeats`, same bounds.
- **`required = true`** comes from a data set's `compulsoryDataElementOperands`
  at the grain DHIS2 states them: an operand naming a data element alone marks
  the whole question and every disaggregated cell of it; an operand also naming
  a category option combo marks only that cell.
- **Standard `minValue` / `maxValue` extensions** on the value types that are a
  constraint (`INTEGER_POSITIVE`, `INTEGER_ZERO_OR_POSITIVE`,
  `INTEGER_NEGATIVE`, `PERCENTAGE`, `UNIT_INTERVAL`), typed `valueInteger` or
  `valueDecimal` by the item type and shared by a disaggregated element's
  children.
- **The source data set's, event program's, or program stage's own DHIS2
  attribute values** ride as `D2AttributeValue` extensions, plus data-element,
  tracked-entity-attribute, and category-option-combo support terminology.
- **Four synced directories**: `data-sets/`, `event-programs/`,
  `tracker-programs/` (nested one subdirectory per program,
  `<program stem>/<stage stem>.fsh` plus the program's own `registration.fsh`,
  with the FSH sweep walking subdirectories and pruning one it emptied), and
  `data-dictionary/` for the three shared support pairs.
- **A form that would emit one `linkId` twice** - a DHIS2 section UID reused as
  a data element UID inside one form, which R4's `que-2` forbids and which
  would leave a response naming two questions at once - is skipped whole with
  an aggregate note naming the form and the clashing id, its peers emitted as
  usual.
- **A tracker program is one Questionnaire per program stage**: the stage's
  identity stem as the id, `{prefix}PS_<stage stem>` as the name,
  `$DHIS2-PS` / `$DHIS2-PS-CODE` as its identifiers, the program's own subject
  type on `subjectType`, a title carrying both names ("Child Programme -
  Birth"), and a third `$DHIS2-PROGRAM` identifier slice holding the program
  UID.
- **Plus one registration form for the program itself**,
  `tracker-programs/<program stem>/registration.fsh`, whose questions are the
  program's `programTrackedEntityAttributes` in DHIS2 sort order - typed
  through the very same value-type table, an option-set-bound attribute
  answered from that set's published ValueSet, `mandatory` becoming
  `required = true`. Its identity is the program's own
  (`{prefix}PR_<program stem>`, `$DHIS2-PROGRAM` / `$DHIS2-PROGRAM-CODE`) plus
  a `$DHIS2-TET` slice naming the tracked entity type it enrols an entity as.
- **`Questionnaire?identifier={base}/id/program|<programUid>`** therefore
  selects a program's whole capture surface, registration and stages together,
  on any FHIR server.

#### Subject types

- **`[generate.tracked_entity_types]`** is a UID to FHIR resource type map
  (`Patient`, `Person`, `Practitioner`, `RelatedPerson`, `Group`, `Device`,
  `Location`, `Organization`, `Specimen`; anything else refuses the config)
  that lets a project publish its herds as `Group` and its water points as
  `Location`. It defaults to `Patient`, so a person-tracking project configures
  nothing and every artifact stays byte-identical.
- **The tracked entity type decides the `subjectType`** of the registration
  form and of every stage form of the program alike, and feeds the example
  responses' `subject.type`, `$generate`'s minted subject, and the capture
  server's subject-type check - read off the compiled `subjectType`, warned by
  default and refused under `--strict-codes` - from the same resolution.
- **The guide publishes the map rather than keeping it in `fhir.toml`**: a
  `D2TET_CS` / `_VS` pair over every tracked entity type the run's person-only
  forms register (concept code the DHIS2 UID, display the name the instance
  holds, `dhis2-code` where the instance states one, NAME translations as
  designations under `[generate] locales`) and a `D2TET_CM` ConceptMap beside
  it in `data-dictionary/tracked-entity-types.fsh` stating one `equal` row per
  type onto `http://hl7.org/fhir/resource-types` - every row, not only the
  exceptions, so a consumer resolves a type over `$translate` without holding
  the project's config.
- **`d2w fhir validate` names every type the table does not.** One finding per
  tracked entity type the instance holds that `[generate.tracked_entity_types]`
  never mentions, category `unmapped-tracked-entity-type`, carrying the UID, the
  name the instance holds, and the config line that would type it - a warning on
  a type this build publishes a form for, info on one outside the selection. A
  fifty-type instance gets a fifty-row checklist instead of the silence the
  `Patient` default otherwise applies in.
- **`[generate.tracked_entity_types]` stays exceptions-only and UID-keyed.** A
  run leaving two or more registered types unmapped raises a generate note
  naming each by instance name and UID, which doctor's generate phase reports
  as a warning.

#### Who a person is

- **`[ips.identity]`** nominates, by UID, which tracked entity attribute holds a
  person's `name` (or `given_name` and `family_name` apart), `birth_date`, `sex`,
  `phone`, and - under `[ips.identity.address]` - each address part (`line`,
  `city`, `district`, `state`, `postal_code`, `country`). DHIS2 has no field that
  means any of them, so the nomination is the instance's own statement or there is
  nothing to publish. Absent - the default - the register answers exactly what it
  answered before the table existed, byte for byte, which is what the whole serve
  test suite asserts by passing unchanged.
- **A name is never split, only nominated.** `name` publishes one attribute as
  `name.text`; `given_name` and `family_name` publish two as `given` and
  `family` on the same name. Which half an attribute holds is what its key
  says - nothing reads it off an attribute's name or cuts one value in two.
- **`phone`** publishes as one `telecom` entry of system `phone`, and
  **`[ips.identity.address]`** as one `address`. An address part of DHIS2 type
  `ORGANISATION_UNIT` reads as the unit's name as the guide publishes it - its
  own Location or its registry package's - and a unit the guide does not publish
  leaves its part out rather than filling it with an id.
- **`[ips.identity.administrative_gender]`** maps each value the sex attribute
  holds - the option's DHIS2 code where it is option-set bound - onto one of
  R4's four `administrative-gender` codes, whose binding on `Patient.gender` is
  required. A fifth word is refused when `fhir.toml` loads; a `sex` with no map,
  and a map with no `sex`, are both refused as halves of a dial that would do
  nothing.
- **The value shape is checked against the guide, not guessed.** At startup each
  nomination is looked up in the published `D2TEA_CS` vocabulary and its
  `value-type` checked against what the FHIR element takes - `DATE` for
  `birth_date`, free text for the names and `sex`, `PHONE_NUMBER` or text for
  `phone`, `ORGANISATION_UNIT` or text for an address part. A mismatch refuses the run,
  naming the key and the type it found. An attribute the guide publishes nothing
  about is logged and served, because the guide's silence means the attribute is
  outside the selection rather than wrong.
- **Absence is stated per person, in the IG's own mechanism.** A nominated birth
  date the instance holds no value for keeps the element and carries
  `data-absent-reason` `unknown` on its `_birthDate` sibling - the IPS guide's own
  worked example; a value this server cannot read as a date carries `error`
  instead, because "nobody recorded one" and "what was recorded is not a date"
  are different answers. `name` and `gender` state no absence, being required on
  nothing the register serves, and a sex value outside the map publishes no
  `gender` at all.
- **A nomination adds a reading and removes nothing.** The attribute's own value
  still rides the `D2TrackedEntityAttributeValue` extension as the string DHIS2
  sent, so a client sees both what the instance holds and what the project says
  it means. Nomination reaches only the resource types R4 gives those elements -
  `Patient`, `Person`, `Practitioner`, `RelatedPerson` - and never a `Specimen`
  or a `Location`.
- **One mapping surface, so a synced copy and a live read agree.** The nominations
  ride `TrackedEntityIndex`, which `registered_entity_for` is the sole consumer
  of, so `d2w fhir sync` writes the same bytes the register answers with.

#### What a summary carries about them

- **`[ips] enabled`** is the dial the whole summary surface hangs off, and it is
  false by default. A patient summary is a clinical document about a person, so
  publishing one is a decision a deployment states rather than one it inherits.
  False, `$summary` answers a `not-supported` OperationOutcome naming the key and
  the line that would turn it on; the register, the record, and everything else
  the facade serves are untouched either way.
- **`[ips.sections]`** nominates which recorded values belong in which section of
  a summary, one sub-table per section. `immunizations` is the one section a
  mapping reaches, and any other key is refused by name - a project writing
  `[ips.sections.problems]` is told the key is not one rather than left with a
  table that quietly does nothing.
- **`[ips.sections.immunizations]`** takes `program_stages` and
  `dose_data_elements`, both lists of DHIS2 UIDs and both required together. The
  stages are the ones whose events record doses; the data elements are the ones
  inside them that each record a dose of one vaccine, which is the shape a DHIS2
  immunisation form has - so **the data element is the vaccine and its value is
  the dose**, and `Immunization.vaccineCode` carries the data element's own DHIS2
  coding. A value that is not a UID is refused, and so is either list without the
  other: a stage with no data element nominated records nothing a summary reads,
  and a data element with no stage names values on events nobody said were doses.
- **The IPS binds `vaccineCode` preferably rather than requiredly**, which is what
  lets this section carry real doses out of a DHIS2 coding while an international
  vaccine vocabulary is still missing.
- **The guide publishes the mapping as `D2Section_CM`**, so a consumer audits
  which recorded values a served summary carries without ever holding the
  project's `fhir.toml`.

#### The data dictionary

- **`D2TEA_CS` / `_VS`** is the tracked-entity-attribute support pair the
  registration form's item codes point into: `dhis2-code`, `form-name`,
  `value-type`, a `unique` boolean marking the attributes that are business
  identifiers, and searchability with its provenance.
- **Searchability carries its provenance**: a `searchable` roll-up true where
  any context this run publishes declares it, plus one
  `searchable-<contextUid>` boolean per context that asked the attribute -
  because DHIS2 holds the flag on the join, and two programs asking one
  attribute disagree as readily as they agree. Each per-context property is
  declared once with the context named in words, and every flag is read off the
  very `programTrackedEntityAttributes` / `trackedEntityTypeAttributes` join
  the forms already cost.
- **Input surfaces speak `formName`, reference surfaces speak `name`.** DHIS2
  writes a data element's `name` for analytics and reference and its `formName`
  to clarify what a person is being asked, so a `Questionnaire.item.text` - an
  aggregate question, an event or tracker stage question, a registration form's
  attribute, and the group heading of a disaggregated element - is the form name
  wherever DHIS2 states one and the name wherever it does not. The dictionary is
  the reference surface: a `D2DE_CS` or `D2TEA_CS` concept keeps displaying the
  name and states the form name beside it as a `form-name` string property, so
  one concept reaches both spellings. A disaggregated element's cells are
  labelled by their category option combo, which has no form name of its own.
- **Every dictionary property is declared only where a concept carries it**,
  and `dhis2-code` is written only where DHIS2 states a code rather than
  repeating the UID the concept code already is.
- **`D2EntityLevel`** rides each question, read off
  `trackedEntityType[trackedEntityTypeAttributes]` on the same program fetch:
  true for an attribute the tracked entity type collects, false for one only
  the program asks. That is what makes `d2w fhir forward` write the first onto
  `trackedEntities[].attributes` and the second onto
  `enrollments[].attributes`, the two levels DHIS2 imports a registration at.
  The level rides the item rather than a `D2TEA_CS` property because it is a
  fact about the attribute and the tracked entity type together, and two
  programs on different types can disagree; a question stating no level is
  written on the tracked entity.

#### Examples

- **`Usage: #example` QuestionnaireResponses** declare themselves `InstanceOf`
  the matching response profile, so the publisher validates every example
  against the capture contract on every run, and answer those Questionnaires on
  the same link ids. One file per example under `examples/`, sized and sourced
  by `[generate.examples]` `per_target` / `source`.
- **`source = "synthetic"`** (the default) generates values locally from a
  SHA-256 seed - stable across machines and runs, every option combo filled.
- **An example is captured at an organisation unit its own form is assigned
  to, under an attribute option combo that organisation unit admits and that is
  open for the period the example reports for.** DHIS2 scopes a data set and a
  program to the organisation units it is assigned to and refuses a capture
  outside that scope (`E1029` on an event, `E1041` on an enrollment); it scopes a
  category option to organisation units on top of that and refuses a capture
  keyed to a combo not usable at the organisation unit it was filed from
  (`E8025`); and it scopes the same option to a calendar window, refusing a
  capture whose combo does not cover the whole period it reports for (`E8032`). A
  published example is the shape a consumer copies, so the three are one choice
  rather than three: the organisation-unit selection's own root where every rule
  admits it, and otherwise the first organisation unit by UID that they do, so a
  rerun places it identically, and the combo is drawn from the concepts that
  organisation unit admits for the period the example carries - the newest
  completed period of the form's own period type. A form DHIS2 hangs no
  assignment on, and a form whose assignment names nothing published, fall back
  to that root; a form left with no published organisation unit at all is an
  aggregate note rather than a reference the publisher cannot resolve, and a
  form no organisation unit it admits may file any of its combos at, or whose
  every combo has closed for the period it reports, publishes no example,
  because there is no capture DHIS2 would take.
- **A form no organisation unit may file a capture for is said out loud.**
  `d2w fhir generate` closes such a run with a warning naming the forms and the
  two dials that answer it, the way it does for an empty organisation-unit
  assignment, and files the same fact as a note. `d2w fhir check-artifacts`
  raises a warning-level finding per reference to the vocabulary, read back off
  the published restriction `List`s alone, so a build machine with no DHIS2
  connection asks the same question the run asked.
- **A published stage example answers an enrollment a registration example of
  the same run creates.** A tracker program publishes a registration form and
  its stages together, and the two are drawn as one corpus: the `n`-th
  registration of a program mints the tracked entity and enrollment pair, and
  every stage example of that program is assigned round-robin across those
  registrations. DHIS2 refuses an event naming an enrollment nothing creates
  with `E1313`, and the program mismatch that follows with `E1079`, so a corpus
  minting a pair per example would be a guide whose own examples the instance
  turns down. The load set and the IG examples run the same builder under the
  same rule.
- **An example answers the form it answers.** Only the questions the form's own
  `enableWhen` leaves enabled given the rest of the response are answered - the
  sweep runs to a fixed point, because dropping an answer can close the question
  that depended on it - and every numeric answer falls inside the question's
  `minValue` / `maxValue`, its value type's and its program rules' both. A
  question whose bounds admit no value at all is left unanswered, and both
  outcomes are tallied into one aggregate note apiece.
- **`source = "instance"`** reads real data value sets and tracker events off
  the server: an event program by `program`, a tracker stage by `programStage`
  plus its `program`, whose `fields` also carry `enrollment` and
  `trackedEntity`. An event answering neither declares the base
  QuestionnaireResponse and is tallied in one aggregate note rather than
  dropped. Aggregate data walks back through the six newest completed periods
  of the data set's period type via the `recent_periods` inverse of the ISO
  parser, grouping data values by `(orgUnit, period, attributeOptionCombo)`.
- **Answers are typed from the DHIS2 `valueType`**, with option codes resolved
  to codings carrying the very concept code the terminology target assigned
  that option, so a coding never names a concept the CodeSystem lacks. An
  answer selecting an option that received no concept code is left unanswered
  with its own note, and so is an `ORGANISATION_UNIT` answer naming a unit
  outside the organisation-unit selection, which the IG publishes no Location
  for.
- **Numeric answers** are admitted only in the plain lexical forms an R4
  primitive can carry (`NaN`, `1e3`, `+1`, `01.5` stay strings). Temporal
  answers are cleared against the calendar, the clock, and the R4 offset range
  before they are emitted.
- **`authored` and every `DATETIME` answer** get the offset R4 requires and
  DHIS2 omits: the offset the `[generate] timezone` IANA zone stood at on that
  very timestamp, DST included, or `Z` when the project names no zone
  (BUGS.md #62).
- **A target holding no data is one aggregate note, never a failure.**

#### Organisation unit registry

- **Paired Organization/Location instances** with `Organization/<stem>` /
  `Location/<stem>` `partOf` hierarchy, losslessly embedded GeoJSON, and the
  unit's DHIS2 attribute values as `D2AttributeValue` extensions on both
  halves. On the Location the boundary extension is emitted first, the
  attribute values after it, and the `D2OrganisationUnitLevel` extension last,
  so a regenerate of an unchanged unit stays byte-identical.
- **`[generate.organisation_units] geometry`** decides how much of that
  geometry each Location carries: `full` (the default - the position and the
  boundary), `position` (the point, or the polygon centroid, and no boundary
  extension) or `none` (neither, with `geometry` left out of the DHIS2 read).
  The registry page and the scaffolded `index.md` describe what was chosen, and
  the capture server hands the setting to the organisation units page through
  `GET /facade/uiconfig`, which draws points only, or no map at all, to match.
- **Shipped as pre-built R4 JSON** under `ig/input/resources/registry/`, one
  `Organization-<stem>.json` and one `Location-<stem>.json` per unit,
  serialised from the `dhis2w_fhir.r4` models and loaded by SUSHI as predefined
  resources into `sushi-local#LOCAL` rather than compiled from FSH.
- **`D2Organization` / `D2Location` profiles**, the latter slicing the level
  extension `named level 1..1`, so every published Location states the
  hierarchy level it sits at instead of leaving it to be counted off `partOf`
  hops. The level CodeSystem ships beside them - one concept per depth the
  selection reaches, coded `level-<n>` and displayed under the name the
  instance gives that depth in `/api/organisationUnitLevels` (`Level <n>` where
  it names none), with that name's DHIS2 translations as concept designations
  under `[generate] locales`; the table is one unpaged read per generate run -
  as does a curated
  `registry-examples.fsh` (`D2OrganizationExample` / `D2LocationExample`,
  `Usage: #example`) taking its level and position from the selection's own root
  unit so the publisher validates both registry profiles against shapes the
  instance really holds - kept beside the profiles rather than under `examples/`,
  whose sync deletes every file it did not produce. Its identity is synthetic:
  both profiles require the two DHIS2 identifier slices 1..1, and the pair states
  `d2-example` on each, under the name "Example organisation unit". No DHIS2 UID
  can be that value, so an identifier search over a published guide answers with
  exactly one resource per organisation unit rather than two for whichever unit
  the example was drawn from.
- **These stay FSH** under `ig/input/fsh/organization/`, along with the
  optional whole-selection CodeSystem representation
  (`[generate.organisation_units] terminology`).
- **Published as a package of its own, opt-in.** A guide naming a registry
  package under `[generate.organisation_units.registry]` (`id`, `canonical`,
  `version`, optional `path`) writes no Organization, Location, registry
  profile, registry example or level terminology - both directories are
  emptied - reads the selection once as `id,code,name` instead of walking the
  hierarchy, references every unit by its absolute URL
  `<canonical>/Location/<stem>` in the examples, the assignment Lists and the
  capture page (the only form the IG publisher resolves across a dependency),
  types `D2OrganisationUnit` and every `D2Responses` subject with the package's
  Location profile by canonical, leaves the level extension and the
  organisation-unit NamingSystems to the package, and raises one
  `registry-dependency` note. The Registry page states the package. A guide
  whose canonical equals the registry's is refused. A `fhir.toml` without the
  table is untouched by any of this.
- **The registry package itself** is a project with `kind = "package"` and
  `publishes = "organisation-units"` under `[ig]`: `d2w fhir generate` runs its foundation slice (aliases, the
  organisation-unit NamingSystems, the attribute-value extension, the level
  extension), the organisation units and the pages (Registry plus the unit
  intros), reports the four form-side targets as not applying, and refuses
  `option-sets`, `categories`, `questionnaires`, `examples` and `load-set` by
  name. A registry package selecting a form or naming a registry is refused
  when its `fhir.toml` loads.
- **The translator reads both reference forms.** `location_id_of` takes the id
  off `Location/<id>` and off `<canonical>/Location/<id>`, so a response
  written against either guide resolves its organisation unit.
- **The facade reads both forms too.** The capture UI's reporting-unit picker,
  the `$generate` draw, the assignment grading on receipt, the shape check a
  submission's own subject and organisation-unit extension pass, and the unit a
  receipt names all read a reference through the same rule - so a form assigned
  by absolute registry reference is offered at the units it names, drafts
  inside them, and accepts the example response the generator wrote for it. An
  absolute reference is admitted under an authority this project publishes
  units at - the guide's canonical or its registry package's - and one under
  any other authority is refused by name, because the same id under somebody
  else's registry is a different organisation unit.
- **A form assigned nowhere drafts nothing.** An assignment `List` naming no
  organisation unit this project publishes admits nothing on receipt, so
  `$generate` answers 422 naming that List rather than drafting a capture DHIS2
  would refuse with `E1029`.
- **A draft names its organisation unit the way the guide's own documents do**:
  the relative `Location/<id>` where the guide publishes its own registry, the
  absolute `<registry canonical>/Location/<id>` where a package publishes it.
  Both post, so what decides it is which spelling a client copying a draft
  should learn.
- **Generating, serving, forwarding and checking a depending guide** all find
  the units through one resolver (`dhis2w_fhir.registry_package`): the checkout
  `[generate.organisation_units.registry] path` names, then a `package.tgz` or
  extracted directory given as `--registry-package`, then a `RegistryMissingError`
  naming both remedies. A guide scaffolded with no `path` names its
  `REGISTRY_TGZ` to all four through the Makefile. A tarball is read in place
  with `tarfile`, never unpacked to disk, and only the `Location` and
  `Organization` resources at the package's top level are taken out of it. The
  worked `d2-example` pair under `package/example/` names no organisation unit
  and stays out, and the package's own profiles and ImplementationGuide stay
  where they are, so a facade answering for one guide never holds a second
  ImplementationGuide.
  `d2w fhir serve` preflights the registry in `ServeSettings.resolve`, so the
  refusal lands before the starting banner - in both store modes. **A `--live`
  run over a depending guide serves the package's units too** and walks no
  hierarchy on the instance: units of its own would publish a second identity
  for every place at this guide's base URL, so a client developed against
  `--live` would resolve units the published guide never names. **Both halves of
  `d2w fhir forward` read that one registry**: the guide read off disk and the
  guide built off the instance for a project that has never run SUSHI resolve
  every `Location/<id>` through the package, and a drain that can reach neither
  source refuses before it opens a connection rather than translating against
  places this guide does not publish. The refusal is deliberate rather than a
  fall-back: with no Location loaded, reference
  resolution reads the id as the DHIS2 UID, which is right under
  `naming.source = "id"` and silently wrong under `"code"`.
- **A package serves no capture surface.** `[ig] publishes` says the project
  holds no form, so `d2w fhir serve` over one declares no `QuestionnaireResponse`
  and no `$generate` in its CapabilityStatement, says what it publishes on the
  starting banner and at the service base, and refuses a posted
  QuestionnaireResponse with the same sentence the capture UI shows: "This
  project is a package: it publishes organisation units for guides to depend on,
  and no form. Captures are made in a guide that depends on it, not here." It
  answers `GET /Questionnaire` the same 404 it answers `GET /Specimen`, because
  the CapabilityStatement is the route table and it declares neither.
- **The capture UI over a package is a package UI.** `/facade/uiconfig` carries
  `publishes`, so `serve --ui` over a package draws a rail without Forms,
  Responses, Evaluate, or Playground - the four pages whose reads that server
  answers 404 and whose submissions it answers 405 - and keeps the pages a
  package really has: the overview, the organisation-unit hierarchy and map, the
  terminology, and the server's own contract. The overview says what the project
  is instead of advising a generate that would produce no form, and the four
  addresses still answer: opening `#/forms` from a link kept elsewhere renders
  the same sentence the endpoint answers a client with, plus the way to the
  hierarchy, rather than a card about a read that failed.
- **`d2w fhir check-artifacts` reports a dangling registry reference** as a
  finding of the new `registry` kind, comparing the `<canonical>/Location/<id>`
  references already on disk - in compiled JSON and in generated FSH - against
  the ids the package publishes. It stays offline and connectionless, which is
  what lets `make build` run it; a registry it cannot read at all is one finding
  against `fhir.toml` rather than silence.
- **`d2w fhir generate` counts the references the package carries no place for**
  as it writes them, reading the `Location-<id>.json` files the checkout
  published against the stems this run resolved. The two `[generate.naming]
  source` literals are not that fact: `code-or-id` falls back to the id for every
  unit whose code cannot serve as a stem, so a registry stating it beside a guide
  stating `id` publishes exactly the stems the guide references and nothing
  dangles - and a registry that code-stems some units and falls back on others
  produces a partial mismatch no comparison of two literals has a shape for. The
  note states how many of how many dangle and names the first few, or says
  nothing at all.

#### Site pages

`d2w fhir generate pages` writes a narrative documentation layer into
`ig/input/pagecontent/`.

- **Six site pages**: Forms (a data-set catalog, an event-program catalog, and
  a "Tracker programs" section grouping each program's stages under its own
  heading), Registry, Terminology, Identifiers, Periods, and Capture.
- **The Capture page** states what a third party sends to capture data: the
  single-response-per-request rule; an aggregate, an event, and a tracker event
  response worked step by step against the selected forms with a real period
  and an organisation unit that form is assigned to - the very placement the
  examples target files its own responses from, so the page teaches the capture
  the examples beside it make rather than one DHIS2 refuses with `E1029`, and a
  form the run published an example for is preferred as the worked one; the
  attribute option combination an aggregate response is filed under, as a step of
  its own on a form riding a category combination that is not the default one -
  quoted as a combination the worked organisation unit may file under for the
  worked period, because the instance refuses one it scopes away (`E8025`) or has
  closed (`E8032`) as surely as it refuses a response naming none (`E8023`); the
  logical Patient subject and both tracker extensions; where a client obtains
  the enrollment and tracked entity UIDs
  (`d2w data tracker enrollment list`, outside the guide's scope); the
  `<dataElementId>` / `<dataElementId>.<categoryOptionComboId>` linkId
  grammars; the required rules; the event status map; an answer-typing table
  derived from the same tables the examples answer from; the coded-answer rule;
  and the validate-before-you-send workflow.
- **A form this DHIS2 instance takes no capture for is never the worked one, and
  where the selection holds no other, the page says so.** A form whose every
  attribute option combination the instance scopes away from the worked
  organisation unit, or has closed for the worked period, is one no response
  exists for - the examples target publishes none for it, and the page states
  that outright where it has to work against it rather than quoting a
  combination the instance answers `E8025` or `E8032` to.
- **A walk-through only claims an assignment the run proved.** The aggregate and
  the tracker steps quote an organisation unit only where the run placed one of
  its own examples there, which is what says the form's DHIS2 assignment holds
  it. Where it placed none - a tracker program assigned to organisation units
  below the published `max_level`, say - the page writes the reference as the
  shape it is and states the fact: this guide publishes no organisation unit the
  form is assigned to, and DHIS2 refuses a capture from outside one with `E8022`
  on an aggregate response and `E1029` on a tracker one.
- **`<Type>-<id>-intro.md` intros** that the IG publisher injects into the
  matching artifact pages - one per Questionnaire, and one per option set or
  organisation unit carrying a DHIS2 description.
- **Sync-managed by a markdown generated header**, so the hand-authored
  `index.md` survives every regenerate, with every metadata-derived string
  escaped for the publisher's strict HTML parse and for markdown table cells.
- **Escaping is page furniture only**: the FSH `Title:` / `Description:`
  keywords and the generated markdown, never an element of a served resource,
  whose `title`, `description`, `name`, `alias`, `display`, and `text` all
  carry the DHIS2 text byte for byte.

#### Translations

DHIS2 translations are carried through across the whole surface, filtered by
`[generate] locales`.

- **`NAME`** becomes a CodeSystem concept designation on every vocabulary
  (options, category options, organisation units, and the `D2DE_CS` /
  `D2TEA_CS` data dictionary) and an HL7 translation extension on every title
  and instance name (option-set and category CS/VS titles,
  `Questionnaire.title`, `Organization.name`, `Location.name`).
- **A `Questionnaire.item`** takes its `_text` from `FORM_NAME` where DHIS2
  gives the object a form name, and from `NAME` where it does not.
- **A program stage's composed `<program> - <stage>` title** is translated only
  in the locales translating both halves.
- **Tags are normalised to BCP-47** (`pt_BR` becomes `pt-BR`) and locale-sorted,
  so a regenerate of unchanged metadata is byte-identical.
- **`[generate] locales`** narrows which languages travel; absent means every
  language the instance holds.

#### Artifact naming

- **`[generate.naming]`** configures artifact naming, with underscore-delimited
  computational names (`D2OS_Qdm5fPK5Ra9_CS`, `D2OU_Level_VS`,
  `D2DS_BfMAe6Itzgt`, `D2PS_A03MvHHogjR`).
- **`source` picks the identity stem** every artifact of an object derives
  from: the FHIR resource id, the canonical URL, the file name, and the FSH
  name all follow one resolved segment - across option sets (the CS/VS/
  ConceptMap triple shares one stem), categories, organisation units (registry
  file names, ids, `partOf`, `managingOrganization`), questionnaires, examples,
  and pages.
- **`"id"`** (the default) is the DHIS2 id verbatim, keeping its own case:
  `d2-os-Qdm5fPK5Ra9-cs`.
- **`"code-or-id"`** is the object's code when it meets the R4 `id` bar, fits
  the surface's stem budget with no truncation ever, and is unique among the
  selected peers - else the id, with one aggregate note per surface.
- **`"code"`** is the code always: a selected object with a missing, unusable,
  or colliding code refuses the run before a file is written, with a one-liner
  naming the offenders.
- **Stems are assigned once over the whole selection and read by every target**,
  so a question's `answerValueSet` and an example's coding name the artifacts
  that run writes whichever source is set - while the DHIS2 id and code always
  remain as identifier slices. The option-set plan is the one object the
  terminology target emits from, the questionnaires bind to, the examples code
  from and the pages link to, and it is read from a projection carrying the
  DHIS2 code, so a set is published and referenced under one stem.
- **A `"code"` refusal states how many of the selection cannot serve, the rule
  they are held to** - a stem becomes a FHIR resource id, so ASCII letters,
  digits, hyphen and dot, 1 to 64 characters, unique across the selection -
  **and what `"code-or-id"` does with those very objects**: the code wherever
  one can serve, the DHIS2 id on the rest, so that run completes.

#### Publication status

- **`[ig] status`** (`draft` / `active`, settable at scaffold time with
  `fhir init --status`) drives the `sushi-config.yaml` status plus the
  publication `status` and the `experimental` flag on every generated
  definitional resource.
- **NamingSystems take the status alone.** The Organization/Location instances
  are data: their `active` / `status` carries the unit's `closedDate`.

#### Generate notes

- **Every note a generate target raises is a `GenerateNote`** carrying its
  kind - `selection-mismatch`, `selection-closure`, `empty-selection`,
  `selection-gap`, `refused-form`, `form-structure`, `skipped-question`,
  `answer-fallback`, `instance-data-gap`, `build-cost`, `compile-removed`,
  `scaffold-drift`, `registry-dependency`, `code-fallback`, `code-collision`,
  `stem-fallback` - beside
  its text and an `echoes_validate` verdict derived from it.
- **A bare run counts the three kinds that merely restate a `fhir validate`
  finding apart** from what generation itself found
  (`note: 3 distinct note(s) across 2 target(s) (+8 validate echoes); full list
  in ...`), counting each note once across the targets that raised it - which is
  what the summary table's `Distinct notes` column counts, while a target's own
  `[k/N]` step line counts its own share and names it (`379 notes raised here`),
  so the two numbers a run prints for one target are two named numbers,
  while the notes file still carries every one, echoes under a trailing
  per-target `Restatements of validate findings` heading. A note several
  targets share is counted and filed once, on the first target that raised
  it; `--json` keeps the full per-target lists.
- **A solo target prints all of its notes inline**, and `--json` carries the
  whole model.

#### Load sets

`d2w fhir generate load-set` writes a synthetic load set of QuestionnaireResponse
JSON under `load/` (`--per-target`, default 25; `--salt`; `--output-dir`) for
posting at a running facade.

- **Covers every form kind** and places each response at a unit its target is
  really assigned to.
- **A tracker program's corpus is internally consistent**: its registration
  responses mint the tracked entity and enrollment UIDs from the program UID
  and the ordinal - the program UID being in the seed material is what keeps
  one program's identities out of another's, an event answering the wrong
  program's enrollment being `E1079` - and its stage responses reuse those very
  pairs round-robin rather than inventing enrollments nothing creates, which a
  drain lands whole since it posts registrations before events.
- **A `unique` tracked entity attribute** is answered from the minting
  response's own tracked-entity UID in whatever spelling its value type admits
  (textual types embed it, `EMAIL` / `URL` / `PHONE_NUMBER` in their own shape,
  the integer family as a nine-digit derivation on the admitted side of zero),
  because DHIS2 refuses a second registration claiming one business identifier
  with `E1064` and takes its enrollment and every event on it down too. A value
  type with no room for distinctness (`BOOLEAN`, `LETTER`, a date, an
  option-bound attribute) keeps the ordinary draw and is named in a note rather
  than faked out of range.
- **A corpus mints the identities it names so it imports once**;
  `importStrategy=CREATE` refuses a re-import on `E1002` / `E1080` before any
  value is read, which is what `--salt` answers by moving every drawn value at
  once into a genuinely different corpus that the same salt still reproduces.
- **Deliberately not part of a full `generate` run**, because a load set is
  test data rather than IG source.
### Validate the instance

`d2w fhir validate` checks an instance's codes for FHIR-safety: an
instance-wide `/api/metadata` sweep applying the R4 code check, the
`template-hostile-name` check, and the `control-character-name` check to every
object in every collection it returns,
graded against the emission scope the run resolves from the same selection
semantics `generate` uses.

- **Every finding carries a `scope`** of `selection` (on the configured build
  path, where severity means build impact) or `instance` (hygiene the build
  never reads, always `info`).
- **The summary** splits the totals into a `selection findings` row and a
  `code coverage` fraction counting the in-scope objects whose code can serve
  as an identity stem (`usable_code_stem`, the R4 `id` bar). The resolved
  `ValidationScope` costs five id-only reads rather than a second sweep.
- **A package is graded against what it publishes.** With
  `[ig] publishes = "organisation-units"` the project holds no data set, program
  or form - `generate` refuses those targets by name - so the run resolves the
  organisation units and nothing else, makes one id-only read instead of five,
  and every form-side finding is the instance hygiene it is for a project that
  publishes no form. The terminal summary, the Markdown report and the PDF cover
  each carry a `graded against` line and name the surfaces that do not apply
  (data sets, programs, program stages, data elements, tracked entity types,
  tracked entity attributes, option sets, categories, category options).
  `/facade/metadata-health` reads the same scoping off the project it serves.
- **Three deep passes** for what the sweep structurally cannot see: an
  option-set pass gated on `--code-source`; a code-stem pass previewing a
  code-sourced `[generate.naming]` source over the six naming surfaces
  (`code-stem-fallback` warnings under code-or-id semantics,
  `code-stem-refusal` errors under `source = "code"` - the same defect
  predicate generate refuses through, so a validate error equals a generate
  refusal, with collisions graded per id namespace, data sets, event programs
  and tracker stages pooling into the Questionnaire namespace exactly as
  generate resolves them, and every stem read off the code the posture
  **publishes** rather than the one DHIS2 holds - a run screens its names before
  it plans an identity, so under `"substitute"` the option set coded
  `Development activities` stems from `Development-activities` and is neither
  counted nor refused, which is what keeps the two commands stating one number
  and one fact per object; a finding on a code the rewrite left unusable names
  both spellings); and an attribute pass naming every attribute the
  instance left uncoded, whose values therefore ride a bare UID on all five
  resource types the `D2AttributeValue` extension is contexted on, counted as
  `attribute_count` in the report beside the option-set, option, resource-type,
  and object counts.
- **`template-hostile-name`** fires in either code mode on any name holding
  `<`, `>`, or `&` - the characters the IG publisher's template injects into
  HTML unescaped - and reads the object's NAME and FORM_NAME translations beside
  its name, because the generate gate rewrites those two translated properties
  exactly as it rewrites the name: a translated NAME becomes a published
  `_title`, `_name` or designation and a translated FORM_NAME becomes a
  question's `_text`, so an object whose own name is clean and whose `en_GB` name
  carries a `<` is a build the publisher dies on. The message names the locale
  and the property. Its sibling **`template-hostile-code`** reads the code for
  the same three on the six collections whose codes become identifier values
  (`optionSets`, `categories`, `organisationUnits`, `dataSets`, `programs`,
  `programStages`).
- **`spaced-code`** reads every surface the generate gate screens a code on -
  `optionSets`, `categories`, `categoryOptions`, `organisationUnits`, `dataSets`,
  `programs`, `programStages`, `trackedEntityTypes`, `dataElements`,
  `trackedEntityAttributes`, and the options of the deep pass - so the report the
  refusal calls "the full report" names every code the run would rewrite. A code
  the R4 datatype refuses outright is reported as the invalid code it is and not
  a second time here.
- **`control-character-name`** fires in either code mode on any name or form
  name holding a C0 control character (U+0000 through U+001F), which SUSHI
  carries byte-true from the FSH into the compiled resource. Tab, newline, and
  carriage return are the whole of what XML 1.0 admits below U+0020 - and what
  the R4 `string` value regex names - so those are warnings: the published pages
  collapse them while the FSH `Title:` has already flattened them, and one object
  states its name two ways. Every other C0 control has no XML form at all, not
  even a numeric character reference, and the IG publisher writes an XML
  rendering of every resource beside the JSON one, so those are errors. The
  message names the character in words (*a tab character*, *the control
  character `\x01`*) and `display_code` prints it as an escape rather than
  letting an invisible byte reach the page as nothing. Under `"substitute"` the
  rewrite collapses every control character to the space it stood in, so the
  finding is `info` and names both spellings. It is a category of its own, not a
  `template-hostile-name`: no HTML template is what breaks, and a
  `control-character-name` error does not refuse a generate run.
- **`invisible-character`** fires on a name, form name, option name, or code
  holding a stray Unicode format character (a zero-width space, zero-width
  joiner, byte-order mark, direction mark): one touching only visible ASCII. A
  zero-width space inside Lao, Thai, Khmer or Myanmar text is how those scripts
  mark word breaks and is not reported. A code is a warning in scope, since it
  reaches identifiers, resource ids and URLs; a name or form name is `info` and
  is published as DHIS2 holds it. `display_code` prints the character as its
  `\uXXXX` escape. Organisation unit phone numbers and emails are cleaned by
  `d2w fhir generate` instead (`contact_value`), which drops the format
  character on publish and raises a note naming each affected unit.
- **Both hostile-character checks are graded the same way**: an error for an in-scope `<`, a warning for
  an in-scope `>` / `&`, and `info` for either out of scope - because a name
  and an identifier value alike land in HTML the publisher writes unescaped and
  then strict-parses, so an aborted build is what a `<` costs on either surface
  and a malformed page is what the other two cost, and the build aborts only
  after every resource has been rendered. Both errors are also generate
  refusals, through the shared `build_aborting_code` / `build_aborting_name`
  predicates.
- **The run grades under the project's `[generate] hostile_names` posture**,
  and the summary row, the Markdown report, and the PDF cover each state which
  posture produced the counts. Under `"substitute"` a name carrying `<` is
  rewritten for publication, so its finding is `info` and its message names both
  spellings (`published as 'Vitamin A given to under 5y' ... DHIS2 keeps
  'Vitamin A given to < 5y'`), and a `spaced-code` finding names the hyphenated
  code the guide publishes; under `"refuse"` and unset the grading is the
  refusing one. `template-hostile-code` follows the posture the same way: an
  in-scope `<` code is an error under `"refuse"`, and `info` under
  `"substitute"`, which rewrites it before any emitter reads it.
  `--hostile-names substitute|refuse` reads the instance under the other posture
  for a what-if run; the flag beats the config, the config beats unset, and exit
  1 follows the graded severities.
- **The name grade and the generate refusal hold in both directions.** Every
  name graded a `selection`-scoped `template-hostile-name` error refuses a
  `d2w fhir generate` run, and every name generate refuses is graded that error
  here. The `ValidationScope` therefore carries one surface per kind of object a
  selection can publish - option sets, options, categories, category options,
  organisation units, data sets, programs, program stages, tracked entity types,
  data elements, and tracked entity attributes - rather than only the six whose
  codes become identity stems. Codes stay asymmetric on purpose: a data element's
  code is a concept property the publisher escapes, so neither command gates it.
- **`--details` degrades at 80 columns rather than folding.** Every cell is cut
  to what the terminal carries before the table is built, so the table asks for
  no more room than the screen has: nothing folds down the page, nothing is
  squeezed to a blank stub, and each row is one line. The scope, the category,
  the resource type and the code are dropped in that order when the terminal is
  too narrow for them - the `findings by category` rollup above the table counts
  the first two and the Markdown, CSV and PDF reports carry all four. What is
  left is what a reader acts on: how bad it is, which object, and why. 80 columns
  is what a non-TTY pipe gets. The Object cell is cut on its DHIS2 name and never
  on its UID - the UID is what a reader greps the report files for and types
  every remedy against, and an 11-character UID rendered one character to a line
  names nothing - and the sentence saying what a finding costs takes whatever the
  other columns leave, which makes it the cell a narrow terminal shortens.
- **The scope and both restrictions keep the error meaning "this build will
  fail"**: a dashboard is never generated and a data element carries its code
  through an escaped surface, so neither is a finding; `<` is the only
  character seen to abort a build; and an unselected object cannot abort this
  project's build, so only errors gate exit 1.
- **Reports** are written as Markdown, CSV, and PDF (clickable contents,
  bookmarked sections, Lao-script and symbol font support, so the very code a
  finding is about renders in the page reporting it) into `--output-dir`, with
  exit 1 on errors and `--fail` / `--no-fail` gating the exit code. The PDF
  library narrates its own render at debug level, so nothing but the command's
  own `info:` / `note:` / `warning:` lines reaches the terminal.
- **The terminal is a status view**: the summary table with the selection split
  and the code-coverage fraction, a rollup row per (severity, scope, category)
  with the instance rows dimmed, every error individually because an error
  names the object that gates the build, and one closing line splitting the
  pass into selection warnings, selection infos, and instance findings before
  pointing at the report file. `--details` expands every finding.

### Serve the guide

`d2w fhir serve` is the second verb over the same project: a FastAPI facade
bound to loopback by default that loads the project once at startup.

- **Two APIs in one process.** The base URL is FHIR's - the reads and searches,
  the capture POST, and the declared operations `$generate`, `$translate`,
  `$summary`, and `$evaluate` - and `/metadata` is the whole of its contract.
  Everything the facade answers about **itself** is a separate API mounted at
  `/facade`, with its own OpenAPI document at `/facade/openapi.json` and an
  interactive page at `/facade/docs`: `/facade/whoami`, `/facade/spool`,
  `/facade/uiconfig`, `/facade/metadata-health`, `/facade/evaluate`, the two
  `/facade/terminology` reads, and the tracked-entity enrollment listing and
  record. `/cds-services` is neither: CDS Hooks fixes discovery at
  `{base}/cds-services` the way FHIR fixes `{base}/metadata`, so it sits at the
  base URL beside FHIR. The document and its page are readable in every
  `auth_scope`, for the reason `/metadata` is - a contract nobody may read is a
  contract nobody can meet.
- **The store** is the compiled `ig/fsh-generated/resources` merged with the
  predefined `ig/input/resources/{registry,terminology,categories}` tree SUSHI
  never re-emits. With `--live` it is the same read set built straight off a
  DHIS2 instance through one client opened during startup and held open for the
  life of the process: no read of the store touches DHIS2 again, but the
  connection stays because `Patient` and the enrollment listing answer from the
  instance per request. A live build screens DHIS2's names and codes through the
  project's own `[generate] hostile_names`, at the same choke point a generate
  run screens at, so one project means one set of names whichever way it is
  served. Under `substitute` a form is served under the name the compiled guide
  publishes it under; under `refuse` and unset a live serve is byte-true and
  aborts over no name, because serving is not generating.
- **What one mode publishes, both modes publish, and a test holds them to it.**
  The live store and `d2w fhir generate` build their JSON artifacts from one
  instance read through one set of builders, so every file a compiled project
  commits under `ig/input/resources` is a document the live store serves under
  the same id and the same bytes: the assignment Lists, the registry, the
  terminology and its ConceptMaps, the attribute-option-combo vocabularies, and
  the organisation-unit restriction Lists each combo concept names. Both stores
  are built off one mocked instance and compared artifact for artifact, so a
  keyword one call site stops passing is a failing test rather than a family of
  documents only one of them publishes - which is how a `--live` draft came to
  name a combo DHIS2 refuses at the unit it was drawn for, with `E8025`.
- **A worked example is held, and published by nothing.** A guide compiles an
  exemplar beside its registry profiles - the `Usage: #example` Location and
  Organization that show what a published organisation unit looks like - and its
  own `ImplementationGuide` resource names them on `definition.resource[]`
  (`exampleBoolean`, `exampleCanonical`). The store reads that and keeps them out
  of what it publishes: out of every searchset, out of every count, out of the
  units `$generate` draws a place to report from, and out of what a capture may
  name. So `GET /Location?_count=0` on a compiled guide answers the number
  `d2w fhir generate` wrote, exactly as a `--live` run does. Each example stays
  readable at its own `GET /{type}/{id}`, because the guide's published pages
  link to it there.
- **`/metadata` is the route table.** A resource type the statement declares no
  interaction for answers 404 naming `/metadata`, rather than an empty searchset
  that would read as "this guide published none of those" - so a package
  publishing organisation units answers `Questionnaire` the way it answers
  `Specimen`. The declared set is the read types this project actually publishes:
  `Questionnaire`, `CodeSystem`, `ValueSet`, `Location`, `Organization`, `List`,
  `ConceptMap`, `NamingSystem`, and the guide's own conformance resources, plus
  `QuestionnaireResponse` where the project receives one.
- **Four CodeSystem/ValueSet pairs the foundation FSH declares** are included -
  form type, period type, organisation-unit levels, and the organisation-unit
  code list `[generate.organisation_units] terminology` turns on - each built
  from the very Python vocabulary its FSH template renders and gated dict-equal
  against the SUSHI-compiled pair.
- **The profile is the root `d2w -p`**, resolved before the start banner.
- **Authentication is `[serve] auth`, in four postures.** `none` - the default -
  serves every caller. `token` takes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and compares
  it against `D2W_FHIR_SERVE_TOKENS` with `hmac.compare_digest`; the tokens come
  from the environment and never from `fhir.toml`, and rotating them is replacing
  the variable and restarting. `dhis2` takes the caller's own DHIS2 credentials -
  HTTP Basic, or a personal access token as `Authorization: ApiToken <token>` -
  and validates them with one `GET /api/me` against the same instance the live
  run reads, in a fresh request carrying the caller's header and never the
  runtime's client, cached about a minute against a hash of that header. The
  validated username becomes the request identity, and under this posture every
  register read is answered under the caller's own DHIS2 authorization. `jwt`
  takes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from an external OpenID Connect issuer
  and verifies it locally against that issuer's JWKS; the value of
  `[serve.jwt] username_claim` becomes the request identity. `oauth2` is the name
  reserved for an authorization server this facade would run itself and is
  deliberately not accepted: DHIS2 2.43.1's authorization server 500s for any
  client its API creates (BUGS.md 96) - a deployment wanting bearer tokens today
  states `jwt` and names the issuer it already has.
- **The `jwt` posture is `[serve.jwt]`, verified locally against the issuer's
  published keys.** `issuer` names the OpenID Connect issuer identifier and is
  required for the posture; `audience` is checked only when stated;
  `username_claim` defaults to `preferred_username` and names the claim that
  identifies the caller; `forward_bearer` decides whether a register read carries
  the caller's token to DHIS2. While the server starts it reads
  `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration` and the `jwks_uri` it names, and
  every request after that is checked in memory with no round trip: the signature
  against the key the token's `kid` selects, over RS256/RS384/RS512 and
  ES256/ES384/ES512 and no symmetric algorithm (a shared-secret algorithm
  verified against a public key is the algorithm-confusion attack), `iss`, `exp`
  with a minute of clock leeway and no token accepted without one, `nbf` where
  stated, `aud` where configured, and the username claim. The JWKS answer's own
  `Cache-Control: max-age` is honoured with a five-minute floor and no ceiling; a
  `kid` this process does not hold forces one refetch, so a key rotation is not
  an outage, and that refetch is itself floored at a minute so a stream of
  invented `kid`s costs the issuer one read. Revocation is the stated trade: a
  token withdrawn before it expires stays valid here until it expires.
- **Under `jwt`, the register is refused rather than read as the facade.** DHIS2
  resolves a foreign issuer's JWT only when the instance was configured to trust
  the same issuer (`oidc.jwt.token.authentication.enabled`), which this facade
  cannot read and will not guess, so `[serve.jwt] forward_bearer` states it and
  is false by default. False answers every register read 501 with an
  OperationOutcome naming both halves that would make it answerable; true
  forwards the caller's `Bearer` header over exactly the path the `dhis2` posture
  forwards `Basic` over - same opaque header, same credential-free pool. There is
  no silent fallback to the facade's own profile, which under an administrator
  profile would be DHIS2's whole ownership and access-level model skipped with no
  break-the-glass audit entry.
- **`[serve] auth_scope` says how much the posture covers.** `write` - the
  default - guards `POST /QuestionnaireResponse` and nothing else, which is the
  facade's whole state-changing surface: `$generate`, `/facade/evaluate`, `$evaluate`,
  and a CDS Hooks call are POSTs that write nothing. `all` guards every router but
  `/metadata`, which stays open in every posture so a client can read the posture
  it has to meet; `/facade/openapi.json` and `/facade/docs` stay open for the
  same reason, and the capture UI's own files stay open too.
- **`GET /facade/whoami` names the caller, and carries the check under every scope.**
  A caller is named only where a posture is configured: under `auth = "none"` the
  address answers 404 saying this server authenticates nobody, so it names nobody,
  and that `/facade/whoami` answers a caller only where `[serve] auth` states a posture -
  the address's own refusal rather than the read catch-all calling `whoami` a
  resource type nobody asked for. It answers `{posture, username, name}`: the DHIS2 username under `dhis2`, the
  `[serve.jwt] username_claim` claim under `jwt`, and no username at all under
  `token`, which names a deployment rather than a person. Wrong credentials meet
  the same 401 and the same OperationOutcome every other refusal carries. It is
  what gives a verdict on a credential without spending one, which under the
  default `write` scope is otherwise only discoverable by making a submission.
- **The `dhis2` posture's 401 challenges with `xBasic`, not `Basic`.** A browser
  meeting `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` on a request a page made opens its own
  credential dialog and leaves the request pending, so the capture UI would hang
  on Submit instead of rendering the refusal. The scheme callers **send** is
  unchanged, and the header reads the same for every caller rather than shifting
  by `Accept` or user agent.
- **`dhis2` forwards the caller's credentials on every register read.** The
  tracked entity read, the identifier search, the register listing and its
  counts, the enrollment listing, and the registered context of `/facade/evaluate` and
  `$evaluate` are sent
  to DHIS2 carrying the caller's own `Authorization` header, verbatim and
  unparsed, over a pooled connection the process holds open with no credential
  of its own - so DHIS2's five authorization gates (authority, sharing, the
  data-element bits, the three organisation-unit scopes, ownership with access
  levels) are enforced per caller by DHIS2 itself, and the facade computes no
  permission of its own. DHIS2's verdicts are answered as they stand: a tracked
  entity a caller may not see is the 404 DHIS2 gave, and a 401 or 403 is carried
  rather than turned into a 502. Nothing on the path is cached - the one cache
  is `auth`'s identity cache, keyed by a hash of the header and holding a
  username. Each forwarded read carries one header of the facade's own,
  `X-DHIS2W-Facade`, naming the software and version; never the username, which
  the caller's header already carries. A register read presenting no credential
  is a 401 in either scope, since there is nobody to answer as; one presenting
  credentials is answered in either scope, checked on the spot through the same
  cache.
- **The facade's own profile still answers the work no caller asked for.** The
  startup store build, the instance address `/facade/uiconfig` hands the capture
  screens, and `d2w fhir forward`'s drain read and write as the facade's (or the
  forwarding) profile in every posture, because none of them acts on behalf of a
  request - so least privilege still applies to that profile, and under `none`
  and `token` it is what answers every caller.
- **`rest.security` says so under `dhis2`**: the description states that reads
  of the register are answered under the caller's own DHIS2 authorization, and
  the `write`-scope sentence names the register as needing credentials rather
  than claiming every read is open.
- **Five startup refusals, in `ServeSettings.resolve`** beside the sibling
  preflights, so `d2w fhir serve` and an embedder meet the same ones: binding an
  interface other than loopback while neither the run nor `fhir.toml` has stated
  a posture (the message names the fhir.toml line to write), the `token` posture
  with `D2W_FHIR_SERVE_TOKENS` unset, the `dhis2` posture on a compiled run,
  which has no instance to check anybody against, the `jwt` posture with no
  `[serve.jwt] issuer`, and `[serve.jwt] forward_bearer` on a compiled run, which
  has no instance to forward to. A sixth refusal is a round trip rather than a
  value, so it lands while the server starts: a `jwt` run whose issuer this
  machine cannot reach raises the same `ServeAuthConfigurationError` from
  `open_serve_runtime` before a single request is taken.
- **`/metadata` declares `rest.security` in every posture**, `none` included, so
  a client never infers an absence: the DHIS2 posture names `Basic` by its code
  in R4's `restful-security-service` value set and the personal access token as
  text, the token posture states its scheme as text, the `jwt` posture names
  `OAuth` by its code with `JWT bearer token` as text and carries the issuer in
  an extension on the element (never a key, never the audience, never the claim
  name) while its description states whether the register is forwarded or
  refused, and the `none` posture says in words that every caller is served.
- **The check is one FastAPI dependency**, mounted over the routers
  `ServeRouters.guarded` names. An embedding application reads that set and
  mounts its own dependency in its place, writing a `RequestIdentity` onto
  `request.state` if it wants captures attributed; `register_routes` takes the
  same seam as its `authentication` argument.
- **Attribution.** Under `dhis2`, the validated username lands on the receipt as
  `submitted_by`; `d2w fhir spool --details` shows it as a **Captured by** column
  when any receipt has one, and the forward report carries it through. It is
  facade-side provenance and says nothing about the identity DHIS2 stores: a
  drain posts as the forwarding profile, and `storedBy` is DHIS2's own stamp of
  that profile.
- **Configuration.** `host`, `port`, `auth`, `auth_scope`, `strict_codes`,
  `capture`, `ui`, and
  `spool_dir` fall back to the `[serve]` table of `fhir.toml`, which
  `make serve` / `make serve-live` read too, with flags
  beating the table beating the defaults and `--strict-codes` /
  `--no-strict-codes` reaching all three levels.
  The precedence is `ServeSettings.resolve`, in `dhis2w-fhir-serve`, so an
  embedded facade asks for the posture `d2w fhir serve` has by name rather than
  reproducing it: it applies the flag-over-table precedence, resolves the DHIS2
  profile into the address the screens link out to, and refuses a project with
  nothing compiled.
- **`capture` and `spool_dir` carry no flag**, because each says what the
  server *is* rather than what one run does. `capture = false` is the viewer
  posture: it mounts a 405 that names the key in the create route's place and
  drops `create` from `/metadata`, while every read, `$generate`, and every
  receipt already spooled answers exactly as before. `spool_dir` moves the
  receipt tree - relative to the project unless absolute - through the one
  `resolve_spool_root` the forwarder reads the same key through, so the writer
  and the drainer cannot land on two directories.
- **Content negotiation.** Every FHIR route answers `application/fhir+json`; an
  `Accept` that rules JSON out is a 406 naming the one format served, while
  `/facade/spool`, `/facade/uiconfig`, `/facade/metadata-health`, `/facade/evaluate`, `/facade/terminology/*`, and
  `/cds-services` negotiate nothing. `POST /` is a 405 saying the facade runs no batch and no
  transaction.
- **`_format` as R4 defines it.** `_format=json`, `_format=application/json`,
  and `_format=application/fhir+json` - in any casing - make JSON acceptable
  whatever the `Accept` header said, so any FHIR query is a link a browser can
  open. Any other value is a 406 naming the three spellings, even where the
  header would have admitted JSON. It narrows no search: a route that screens
  its search parameters passes over it.

#### Evaluating, terminology, and CDS Hooks

- **`POST /facade/evaluate`** runs one FHIRPath expression, CQL library, or compiled
  ELM library over a resource this facade serves - one from the guide by type
  and id, one posted inline, or one tracked entity read from the DHIS2 instance
  a live run holds open. It answers typed results, one row per CQL define, and
  real diagnostics: a parse failure carries the line and column its parser
  stopped on, and a define that refuses carries its message on its own row. A
  bad expression is a 200 with the reason, never a 500. The engine reaches the
  named context and nothing else - no library path is passed and no file is
  opened.
- **`POST /$evaluate`** is the same evaluation answered as the `Parameters`
  resource a FHIR client expects from an operation: one parameter per define
  named by the define, `value[x]` for a single primitive, `resource` where a
  define answered a FHIR resource, one `part` per value where it answered
  several, an `OperationOutcome` part where a define refused, and an `outcome`
  parameter whose issue carries the line and column a parser stopped on. It is
  system-level - `[base]/$evaluate`, declared at `rest.operation` in `/metadata`
  under a definition this project defines - because what it runs over is
  whichever resource the request names, so no resource type owns it. A
  `Parameters` body naming `language`, `source`, `expression`, and a `context`
  of the same three kinds is canonical; the plain `/facade/evaluate` body is read at the
  same address for a caller who already has one. A define that matched nothing
  carries no parameter, because FHIR has no empty collection - which is what
  `/facade/evaluate`'s own shape exists to keep.
- **`GET /facade/terminology/validate-code`** and **`GET /facade/terminology/lookup`** answer
  about the CodeSystems and ValueSets this project publishes: is this code in
  that set, and what is this code called. It is not a terminology server, and
  says so - a SNOMED CT or LOINC code is answered "this server publishes no
  code system under that url".
- **`GET /cds-services`** and **`POST /cds-services/{id}`** are CDS Hooks, one
  service wide: it evaluates a CQL library the caller sends, or one this guide
  publishes as a Library, over the resources the hook prefetched, and answers a
  card per define that resolves to true or to a message. `fhirServer` is read
  and never followed.
- **The Evaluate screen** in the capture UI is all of the first of those as a
  place to click: a language, a worked example already loaded, a context picker
  offering exactly what the endpoint offers, and a parse error shown against
  the line it names.
- **The source boxes are CodeMirror 6 editors**, not textareas: JSON is read by
  its own grammar with brace matching, and FHIRPath and CQL by stream
  tokenisers this project writes, so keywords, strings, comments, and date
  literals are told apart on both grounds. The colours are CSS tokens declared
  beside every other palette in `index.css`, so a theme change or a switch of
  ground repaints the editor with nothing re-created. The editor is deferred behind `React.lazy`
  into its own chunk, so a client that only fills forms in never downloads it.
  The same read-only renderer paints the JSON results, the receipt page's
  **Raw QuestionnaireResponse**, and the Server page's **Raw
  CapabilityStatement**.
- **A reference panel sits beside the editor**, on two tabs. **Examples** holds
  every runnable example on named shelves - 29 FHIRPath, 18 CQL, 8 ELM, each
  titled by what it answers rather than by the feature it uses, each loading
  into the editor on a click, and every one of them verified to run against the
  shipped context or a stored resource. The language tab states what THIS
  engine answers - the FHIRPath function and operator vocabulary, the CQL
  header, retrieves, query clauses and interval vocabulary, and the ELM library
  shape and expression nodes - drawn from the engine's own registries rather
  than from the published specifications, so nothing on it is a name the server
  would refuse. Each language's shelf of refusals is stated beside what it
  refuses: an unknown function, an unresolved value set, a library with no
  identifier.

#### Read and search

- **`GET /metadata`** answers a `kind #instance` CapabilityStatement
  instantiating the IG's own `D2CaptureServer` and narrowed to the types this
  store actually holds.
- **`GET /{type}/{id}`** answers the resource byte-faithfully as the project
  published it.
- **`GET /{type}?_id&url&identifier&_count`** answers a searchset Bundle whose
  `self` link echoes only the parameters that were applied, so
  `identifier={base}/id/program|<uid>` selects one program's stages, `_count`
  caps the entries rather than paging them and `_count=0` states the total
  alone, and an unrecognised parameter is ignored rather than refused.
- **The guide's own conformance resources are served, by default.**
  `StructureDefinition`, `ImplementationGuide`, `OperationDefinition`, and the
  requirements `CapabilityStatement` that `/metadata` instantiates are read and
  searched on the same routes and the same grammar as every other read type, so a profile canonical named on a response, an extension url carried
  inside one, and the `$generate` definition `/metadata` names all resolve
  against the server that served them - `url={canonical}` is the search, since a
  client holding a canonical holds no id. They come out of the compiled guide in
  either store mode: a `--live` run hosts whatever SUSHI last compiled beside the
  project, and a run with nothing compiled beside it holds none and declares
  none. It is the default until the guide is published under a canonical of its
  own, and there is no dial for it.

#### The tracked entity register

Under `--live` only, `GET /{resourceType}?identifier=` is the output leg: one
read surface per FHIR resource the published `D2TET_CM` takes a registered
tracked entity type onto, so a project tracking people alone serves `Patient`
and one that also registers specimen batches serves `Specimen` beside it, over
exactly the types the map names. The artifact is the contract;
`[generate.tracked_entity_types]` is what produced it, and the server never
reads that table.

- **A token under `{base}/id/tracked-entity`** reads that tracked entity
  directly - a UID is not an attribute, and a value that is not UID-shaped is
  never spent on a read DHIS2 answers 400 to.
- **A token under `{base}/tracked-entity-attribute/<uid>`** filters
  `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?trackedEntityType=<published TET>&filter=<uid>:eq:<value>&orgUnitMode=ACCESSIBLE`.
  `ACCESSIBLE` always, because a unique attribute gets no organisation-unit
  scope exemption on the tracker endpoint (BUGS.md 74), so a capture-unit scope
  would miss exactly the people identifier search exists to find.
- **A bare value** tries every key at once and folds the results deduplicated
  by tracked entity UID.
- **A key whose value type cannot hold the value is left out, and a key DHIS2
  refuses matched nobody.** The keys are the instance's own - every attribute
  DHIS2 declares unique or searchable - so a clinic keeping a zip code
  searchable puts a NUMBER key in the same fan-out as the names, and
  `filter=<zip>:eq:Sebhat` draws a 400 rather than an empty page. The declared
  value type settles it before the request goes out, and the 400 the rest can
  still draw is that key matching nobody: the keys that could hold the value
  answer, and one of the instance's keys never stands between a person and
  their own record.
- **One FHIR resource type is one register serving the UNION of its tracked
  entity types.** Two DHIS2 types mapped to `Device` - a cold-chain fridge and a
  delivery vehicle - are one `GET /Device` answering about both: no collision,
  no refusal, no last-writer-wins. The read, the search, the listing, and the
  `_count=0` count are all parameterized by the list of types the resource is
  served over, `/metadata` names every type in that register's documentation,
  and each served resource still states its own type as a `meta.tag`.
- **`_tag` asks that union about one of its types.** R4's own token search over
  `meta.tag`, which is the very element the type is stated in:
  `_tag={base}/id/tracked-entity-type|<uid>`, or `_tag=<uid>` for the code
  alone. Values widen the way `identifier` values do. It narrows the listing
  walk, the identifier search, and the count alike; it rides every `next` and
  `previous` link so a walk stays inside the type it started in; under
  `[serve.search] backend = "projection"` it narrows the store's own query
  rather than thinning its pages; and a tag naming a type that resource is not
  served over is an empty searchset rather than a refusal. Declared as a
  `searchParam` on every register entry of `/metadata`.
- **`d2-attribute` filters the register by what a record holds**, where
  `identifier` names who it is. `d2-attribute={trackedEntityAttributeUid}|{value}`
  is one attribute and one value; the parameter repeated narrows to whoever holds
  every value named, and a comma is part of the value rather than a separator,
  because a DHIS2 attribute value may contain one. **It answers equality and
  nothing else** - no prefix, no substring, no range, no `:missing` - forgiving
  case alone, because DHIS2's own `eq` on a tracked entity attribute is
  case-insensitive (BUGS.md 109) and one operator must not mean two things across
  the backends. It narrows the listing, the identifier search, `_content`, and the
  `_count=0` count alike, and rides every `next` and `previous` link. Under
  `backend = "dhis2"` it becomes a `filter=<uid>:eq:<value>` on the tracker query,
  repeated once per filter and ANDed by the endpoint; under `"projection"` it is
  one indexed read of the attribute values the sync already wrote.
- **What each register filters on is declared per register, in two places.**
  `/metadata` names the attributes in the `d2-attribute` `searchParam`'s
  documentation - each with its name, its DHIS2 value type, and the canonical of
  the published ValueSet where DHIS2 binds an option set - and `/facade/uiconfig` carries
  the same set as values under `tracked_entities.registers[].filter_attributes[]`,
  so a screen draws a select over a coded attribute and a box over the rest. Each
  entry names the tracked entity types that declare it under `types[]`, so a screen
  narrowed to one type of a register offers that type's own attributes rather than
  the union's - a register carrying a person and a focus area does not offer a
  focus area's reader a filter on first name. The
  set is what the published registration forms ask of that register's own tracked
  entity types, so a register of specimens filters on a sample's attributes and
  never on a person's; there is no config dial narrowing it, because it filters on
  values every response already carries. An attribute a register does not filter
  on is a 400 naming the ones it does, never an empty searchset.
- **Every search runs through a `NameSearchIndex`**, which answers with tracked
  entity identifiers and never with records; each match is then read back by UID
  under the credentials the request runs as, so DHIS2 authorizes every record
  this server hands out whatever found it. `[serve.search] backend` names the
  index and has two values. `"dhis2"` - the default - is the instance itself, one
  `filter=<uid>:eq:<value>` query per key, which is the search a live run has
  always run. `"projection"` is the synced copy `d2w fhir sync` fills: one
  indexed query however many keys and types are in scope, plus `_content` for a
  search across every value a person holds. `"index"` arrives with the OpenSearch
  backend and is refused until then, naming `serve.search.backend`. The seam is
  `ProjectionStore` and `NameSearchIndex`, both exported, both documented in
  [the materialized projection](design/projection.md).
- **The identifier set** is the attributes `D2TEA_CS` publishes `unique` - not
  `searchable`, which a superuser is not held to. The tracked entity types come
  from the registration forms the store publishes, and an unmatched identifier
  or an unpublished system is an empty searchset rather than a 404. Every
  parameter the register cannot apply is refused with a 400 naming the ones it
  does answer - `identifier`, `_tag`, `d2-attribute`, and `_content` under the
  synced backend - rather than answered with the register dressed as a match set.
- **A search naming no parameter at all is the listing** rather than an empty
  search: the register paged, for a client with no identifier to type. It takes
  `_count` (clamped to `[serve.tracked_entities] page_size_limit` rather than
  refused, defaulting to `page_size`, and `_count=0` answering how large the
  register is without building a page) and `page`, an opaque token because one
  page can sit part-way through a DHIS2 cursor per tracked entity type at once,
  with `self` / `next` / `previous` links a client follows rather than
  constructs - no `previous` on the first page, no `next` on the last, so the
  end is a missing link rather than an empty page.
- **`total` is the whole searchset counted.** DHIS2 counts one tracked entity
  type at a time, so a listing over several asks each type for its count: one
  count-only request per type, spent on the first page of a walk and carried
  through the rest on the page token, and states the sum - absent only where
  the instance stated no count for one of those types, rather than guessed or
  walked.
- **The whole people surface is `[serve.tracked_entities]`' to give.**
  `enabled` false answers none of it even under `--live`; `listing` false keeps
  the identifier search and drops the browse; `events` false keeps identity and
  drops one entity's own record; `page_size` / `page_size_limit`
  size a page and cap what may be asked for; `tracked_entity_types` narrows
  search and listing to named types (the laboratory instance that registers
  specimens beside patients); and `search_attributes` names the search keys in
  place of the default set, which is every attribute DHIS2 declares unique or
  searchable - uniqueness names a subject, searchability is DHIS2's own
  statement that people are looked up by it, and keying on uniqueness alone
  would refuse the clinic finding a woman by her searchable first name. Several
  matches is a normal answer the listing already renders. Each refusal names
  the setting and the line to change.
- **The projection is identity, plus whatever `[ips.identity]` nominated**: `id`
  and an `identifier` under `{base}/id/tracked-entity`, one `identifier` per
  unique attribute value under `{base}/tracked-entity-attribute/<uid>`, the
  tracked entity type as a `meta.tag`, and every other attribute value -
  entity-level and enrollment-level alike, so a person found by a program
  attribute comes back holding it - on the `D2TrackedEntityAttributeValue`
  foundation extension. `name`, `gender`, `birthDate`, `telecom`, and `address`
  are filled from the nominations and from nothing else, because DHIS2 states no mapping for them
  and a wrong one is worse than none.
- **`GET /{resourceType}/{uid}`** reads one tracked entity, which is what each
  Bundle entry's `fullUrl` points at. The projection states nothing the target
  resource otherwise defines: the tracked entity uid, the values of the
  attributes DHIS2 declares unique, the type as `meta.tag`, the rest as
  extensions, and the nominated demographics where the resource is one R4 gives
  them - a served `Specimen` states no `Specimen.type`, and no name, and no
  birth date, whatever anybody nominated about people.
- **`GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/enrollments`** is the picker's feed: typed
  JSON rather than a FHIR resource, because EpisodeOfCare-versus-CarePlan is
  still an open decision. It lists enrollment uid, program uid and the name the
  guide publishes it under, status, `active`, `enrolledAt`, and the
  organisation unit uid and registry name - read entity-scoped and never by
  program (BUGS.md 72: a program the person is not enrolled in answers 404
  claiming the person does not exist), with a COMPLETED enrollment listed and
  marked rather than hidden (BUGS.md 70: DHIS2 takes events into one without a
  word).
- **`GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/events`** is the record: every event of that
  entity's enrollments, newest first, each served as the `QuestionnaireResponse`
  its program stage's own published form describes - the stage's canonical as
  `questionnaire`, the entity as `subject` under the resource type the published
  map registers it as, the enrollment and the reporting unit as extensions, the
  event's instant as `authored`, and one item per data value typed by the very
  form a submission is validated against, coded answers carried as the concepts
  the guide publishes. The shape is the capture contract's own, so what a client
  may post is what it reads back, and no clinical resource is invented for data
  DHIS2 states no mapping for. One read of the tracked entity per request,
  entity-scoped throughout (BUGS.md 72 and 91: `/api/tracker/events` demands a
  program on v43, and naming one an entity is not enrolled in answers 404), and
  ordered here because DHIS2 nests the events unordered. `_count` and `page`
  walk it on the register's own dials, `_count=0` answers how long the record is,
  and any other parameter is refused rather than ignored. An event of a stage the
  guide publishes no form for counts in the total, carries no document, and is
  named in an `outcome` entry. One event is read at
  `GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/events/{eventUid}`, which is what each entry's
  `fullUrl` points at - never `QuestionnaireResponse/{id}`, which answers the
  spool's receipts. `[serve.tracked_entities] events = false` refuses the record
  and leaves identity served.
- **`GET /facade/data-sets/{uid}/responses?orgUnit=&period=`** is the aggregate half
  of the same question: what the DHIS2 instance holds for one data set, at one
  organisation unit, over the periods the request names, as one
  `QuestionnaireResponse` per organisation unit, period, and attribute option
  combo the values are filed under - the data set's canonical as `questionnaire`,
  the reporting unit as `subject`, the period and the combo as extensions, and one
  item per cell typed by the very form a submission is validated against. The
  shape is the capture contract's own, so an aggregate form captured through the
  guide reads back through the guide. `orgUnit` and at least one `period` are
  required, because a read without them is every organisation unit for every
  period the data set collects; `period` repeats up to
  `[serve.data_sets] period_limit`, `attributeOptionCombo` narrows to one combo,
  `_count` and `page` walk the pages on the table's own dials, `_count=0` answers
  how many forms the selection holds, and any other parameter is refused rather
  than ignored. The selection is read whole - `/api/dataValueSets` offers no
  cursor and its `limit` truncates silently - and ordered here on
  `(orgUnit, period, attributeOptionCombo)`, so two reads of an unchanged period
  answer the same bytes. One reported form is read at
  `GET /facade/data-sets/{uid}/responses/{responseId}`, whose id is those three
  keys, so the item read needs no parameters. `[serve.data_sets] responses = false`
  refuses the values and leaves the forms published; a `data_sets` list narrows
  which data sets are answered for, and one outside it is answered as one the
  guide publishes no form for.
- **A compiled run holds no client**, so all of them answer a `not-supported`
  OperationOutcome naming `--live`, and `/metadata` declares no register
  resource at all - which is where the record's address is stated too, on the
  QuestionnaireResponse entry whose documents it answers with and on every
  register entry, so a client that found somebody learns where their record is.

#### `$summary`

- **The IPS's own two addresses**, so a client that speaks International Patient
  Summary reaches this without learning a route this project invented.
  `GET /{type}/{uid}/$summary` names one person by their DHIS2 tracked entity UID;
  `GET /{type}/$summary?identifier=` resolves one through the register's own
  identifier search, on the same token grammar `GET /Patient?identifier=` answers.
  An identifier several people hold is refused rather than answered, because a
  summary is about one person and handing back the first match would be the server
  picking which one, and every parameter but `identifier` is refused too.
- **Scoped to the people.** The register serves nine resource types over whatever
  tracked entity types a project maps onto them, and a summary of a cold chain
  fridge is a document nobody has defined - so `$summary` is answered on `Patient`,
  `Person`, `Practitioner`, and `RelatedPerson`, and refused on the rest with a
  message naming the four it does answer on.
- **An IPS document Bundle** is what comes back: a `Composition` coded LOINC
  `60591-5` leading the Bundle, the subject exactly as `GET /{type}/{uid}` serves
  them, and one `Immunization` per recorded dose. The three sections the IPS
  requires - Problems `11450-4`, Allergies and Intolerances `48765-2`, Medication
  Summary `10160-0` - each carry an `emptyReason` of `unavailable` rather than
  content nobody nominated, and Immunizations `11369-6` carries the doses
  `[ips.sections.immunizations]` mapped. Nothing is invented to fill a section: an
  unmapped stage does not become a free-text Observation.
- **Nothing new is read.** The subject is the register's own projection and the
  doses come off the record projection `GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/events` runs
  on, so a value cannot be typed one way in the record and another inside a
  summary. A summary with no mapped section reads no record at all, which is why
  `[serve.tracked_entities] events` is checked only where one is mapped.
- **Deterministic.** Every id is derived from a DHIS2 identifier through `uuid5`
  rather than minted per call, the sections are in a fixed order, and the doses
  keep the record's own order - so two assemblies of an unchanged record differ in
  `Bundle.timestamp` and `Composition.date` and nowhere else.
- **The caveat is part of the document and rides beside it.** `Composition.text`
  states what the document is and is not - which sections carry no mapping, and
  that this is a valid IPS Bundle claiming none of the Creator (IPS) actor's
  obligations - and the same sentence comes back as `X-DHIS2W-Summary-Caveat`, the
  two-place idiom `X-DHIS2W-Projection-As-Of` uses. The all-empty case is served
  rather than refused, saying so; a mapped section with no dose for this person is
  a different fact and reads differently, and a mapped stage the guide publishes no
  form for is named in the section's own narrative rather than passed over.
- **`meta.profile` names no IPS StructureDefinition**, because a live run publishes
  and resolves none: the IG is a vocabulary this document conforms to, not a
  dependency the generated country guide takes on.
- **Declared in `/metadata`** on each register entry whose subjects are people
  and on no other, naming `summary` and the IPS's own
  `OperationDefinition/summary`, so a client reads where a summary lives rather
  than probing for it. The whole surface sits behind `[ips] enabled`, whose
  refusal names the key and the line that would turn it on.

#### `$translate`

- **R4's type-level `GET /ConceptMap/$translate?system&code[&targetsystem]`**
  over the published ConceptMaps, answering a `Parameters` resource carrying
  `result` plus one `match` per mapping (`equivalence`, the target `concept` as
  a Coding, the `source` map), or `result` false with a `message`.
- **Declared in `/metadata`** on the `ConceptMap` resource entry - the entry
  whose URL answers it - and only when the store holds a ConceptMap. Served in
  `--live` mode from the same builders.
- **The maps themselves are read and searched like every other type**
  (`GET /ConceptMap`, `GET /ConceptMap/{id}`), so the mapping tables are
  browsable, not only translatable.

#### `$generate`

The custom instance-level `GET|POST /Questionnaire/{id}/$generate` answers one
served form with a profile-declared synthetic `QuestionnaireResponse` - and is
deliberately not SDC's `$populate`, which means fill-from-real-context.

- **Built from the very `CaptureIndex` the capture path validates against**:
  the same `value[x]` element, the same `minValue` / `maxValue` bounds on both
  their numeric and their `valueDate` spellings (a drawn day is clamped into
  the calendar range the form pins rather than redrawn, so a range the
  generation window does not overlap still terminates), the same `enableWhen`,
  and the same `repeats`.
- **`enableWhen` is evaluated over the whole draw to a fixed point**, so a
  generated response never answers a question its own answers closed: draw
  everything in document order keeping the seed reproducible, then drop what
  the conditions turned out to hide, and repeat until the set stops shrinking.
- **Coded answers are drawn as real concepts** of the served CodeSystem in the
  exact concept-code spelling; a question bound to terminology the project
  never published is left unanswered.
- **Every value is drawn on the axis DHIS2 grades it on** - the DHIS2 value
  type rather than the FHIR item type - so the five types R4 asks as a `string`
  and DHIS2 still parses are spelled the way it parses them (a
  `[longitude,latitude]` `COORDINATE`, an `EMAIL` address, a `PHONE_NUMBER`, a
  one-letter `LETTER`, a `USERNAME`) instead of landing on the free-text
  wording DHIS2 refuses with `E1302`. The types holding a document or a
  reference to a DHIS2 object the guide publishes nothing for
  (`FILE_RESOURCE`, `IMAGE`, `GEOJSON`, `REFERENCE`, `TRACKER_ASSOCIATE`) are
  left unanswered. Both through `seeded_format_constrained_value`, the one rule
  the guide's own example corpus draws from.
- **Wrapped in the context its form kind's response profile requires**: a
  `D2Period` and a `Location` subject for aggregate, plus one
  `D2AttributeOptionCombo` drawn out of the vocabulary the form declares where
  it declares one - whatever the form kind, which is what holds the 201
  invariant for a data set or a program on a non-default category combo,
  `--strict-codes` included; an `authored` instant
  for event; and for tracker-event an `authored` instant plus the
  tracked-entity and enrollment pair a registration receipt in this project's
  spool minted.
- **That join is made server-side** on the program the two forms share, with
  forwarded receipts preferred over received ones and the newest of either,
  rejected ones never - so a generated stage event names an enrollment DHIS2
  can resolve rather than one it refuses with `E1079` and `E1313`. It mints a
  shaped pair of its own only where the spool holds no registration of that
  program, which the contract admits either way because it checks the shape of
  those identifiers rather than their existence.
- **The invariant that generated output POSTed back to this server's own
  `/QuestionnaireResponse` answers 201** is held as a test per form kind, in
  both store modes, and under `--strict-codes`.
- **An optional `seed`** (query for GET, a `Parameters` body for POST, an R4
  `integer` so `0..2147483647`) makes a call byte-reproducible and rides back
  on `QuestionnaireResponse.identifier` under `{canonical}/id/generate-seed`,
  so a seedless call is reproducible too and a corpus can be regenerated from
  the seeds off it.
- **An optional `subject`** (query for GET, a `Parameters` body for POST, a
  `Location/<id>` reference or the bare UID) pins the organisation unit the draft
  reports from instead of leaving it to the draw, so a capture client refilling a
  form somebody has already chosen one on gets a draft drawn there - the
  attribute option combo beside it included - rather than a draft that replaces
  the choice. An organisation unit the form's published assignment does not admit
  is refused with the reason, because drafting a capture DHIS2 answers `E1029`
  would be worse than saying which organisation units admit it.
- **Two facts a compiled Questionnaire cannot carry take documented rules**:
  the data set's period type is read off a served example response answering
  the same form and falls back to `Monthly` (which is every `--live` store,
  since a live build serves no examples), and `TRUE_ONLY` is indistinguishable
  from `BOOLEAN` so both generate either value. The incident date, by contrast,
  is a published fact rather than an inferred one, so a registration always
  generates `D2EnrolledAt` and generates `D2IncidentAt` exactly where the
  form's `D2CollectsIncidentDate` says true, compiled store and `--live` store
  alike.
- **Declared in `/metadata`** on the `Questionnaire` resource entry - the entry
  whose URL answers it - naming the `D2GenerateOperation` OperationDefinition
  the project's own `foundation` target publishes.

#### Capture

The one write is `POST /QuestionnaireResponse`, validated against the served IG
in phases that stop at the first level to find an error.

- **Phase order**: body and R4 shape (400), then the `D2FormType` kind and the
  invariants that kind's profile pins, the questionnaire canonical and its
  index, the ISO period, and finally every answer against that index (422).
- **A tracker registration's envelope** is among those invariants: a subject
  and an enrollment identifier that are DHIS2-UID-shaped, since a client mints
  both and a facade holding no instance data can honestly check nothing else
  about them; an enrolment date that parses; and an incident date graded only
  on its primitive, because the compiled form publishes no
  `displayIncidentDate`. A `unique` tracked entity attribute is deliberately
  not checked for uniqueness, which is global instance state DHIS2 enforces at
  import.
- **The answer** is an OperationOutcome naming each issue by FHIRPath
  expression, or 201 with a `Location` header and an OperationOutcome carrying
  the warnings the server had to record.
- **Coded answers are lenient by default**: a code that names the right option
  in the wrong spelling resolves through the option-UID and DHIS2-code tiers
  and records a warning; a code the served terminology does not hold at all is
  warned about and stored; `--strict-codes` turns both into refusals; two
  options matching one code is an ambiguity refused under either setting.
- **The same dial grades the attribute option combo.** A form declaring
  `D2AttributeOptionCombos` whose response names no `D2AttributeOptionCombo` -
  or names a concept the served vocabulary does not hold - warns and refuses
  under `--strict-codes`, naming the DHIS2 error the write would earn: `E8023`
  on a data set, `E1055` or `E1115` on a program. The mirror case of a
  combo named against a form declaring none grades the same way, because it
  would be stored and silently not written. A coding from another system or
  with no code is refused under either setting.
- **And the same dial grades where that combo may be filed.** A concept
  carrying a `dhis2-organisation-units` restriction is usable only at the
  organisation units every List it names holds, which is DHIS2's own rule for a
  category option scoped to organisation units; a response filed outside it
  warns and refuses under `--strict-codes`, in the shape an organisation unit
  outside the form's assignment is told in and naming the `E8025` the write
  would earn.
- **And when.** A concept carrying a `dhis2-valid-from` / `dhis2-valid-to`
  window is open only while that window covers the whole period a response
  reports for, both ends inclusive - DHIS2's own rule, read off 2.43 with
  validate-only posts: a combo closing on `2016-10-01` takes period `201609` and
  refuses `201610`. A response reporting outside it warns and refuses under
  `--strict-codes`, in the same shape and naming the `E8032 Untimely data entry`
  the write would earn. An event or an enrollment reports for no period and
  carries a date of its own, which the instance grades against the same window
  on import.

#### Receipts and the spool

- **An accepted response is stored as a receipt**: the submission as it
  arrived, stamped with the id it is served under, written atomically to
  `.serve/responses/received/<id>.json`. So reading one back through
  `GET /QuestionnaireResponse/{id}` or `?questionnaire=` says what was
  submitted and never what DHIS2 now holds, and `ls` on that directory is the
  pending count the forwarding phase will drain.
- **The 201 says what the receipt holds, not only which receipt it is.** The
  information issue names the tuple `d2w fhir forward` grades the submission by
  and DHIS2 keys the values it writes by - the form, the organisation unit
  reported from, the period where the form reports for one, and the attribute
  option combo where the form declares one - each as its published name beside
  its DHIS2 UID, with the logical id still leading. A client posting a batch can
  tell its receipts apart from the answers alone, and a clause is written only
  where the submission carries the fact: a tracker response reports for no
  period, and a form on the default category combo is keyed to no combo. The
  receipt page states the same four facts in its capture context block.
- **The spool is a directory rather than an index**: reads re-read `received/`,
  `forwarded/`, `rejected/`, and `withdrawn/` on every request, because
  `fhir forward` renames receipts between them from another process while the
  server is up, and a receipt keeps reading back after a drain rather than
  expiring the id its sender was handed. `[serve] spool_dir` is where that
  tree lives.
- **The served lifecycle names the spool's fourth state**: a receipt
  `d2w fhir withdraw` retracted is read out of `withdrawn/`, counted by
  `GET /facade/spool`, and carries the record of the delete on its row - the event
  UID, the instant, and what the instance keeps - which is the one sidecar
  that is not an import report. The receipt still reads back at
  `GET /QuestionnaireResponse/{id}`, because retracting data from an instance
  does not unsay the submission.
- **A correction or a withdrawal is refused at capture where the project's
  dial is off**: `status = "amended"` is read against `[forward] corrections`
  and `status = "entered-in-error"` against `[forward] withdrawals`, both off
  unless a project says otherwise, and an unreceived one is answered 422 with
  an OperationOutcome naming the key and the value that would accept it. The
  check runs before the profile invariants, so a client that sent a correction
  is told the one thing that decided the request. With a dial on the
  submission is stored like any other receipt, status preserved - what a drain
  then does with the marker is the corrections design's later slices.
- **A translator-refused receipt says so in the listing**: a committing drain
  writes `<id>.refusal.json` beside a receipt it refused and left queued - the
  drain's instant, an attempt count, and the reasons - and `/facade/spool` rows and
  the Responses page state it, so a receipt every drain refuses reads
  differently from one no drain has touched. The move that finally drains the
  receipt deletes the marker, and so does `d2w fhir requeue` - a receipt
  entering the queue has been refused by no drain.
- **A capture is durable before it is acknowledged**: the temporary file is
  `fsync`ed, renamed, and the directory entry `fsync`ed too, so the 201
  promises a receipt that survives power loss rather than one that reached the
  page cache.
- **A file that no longer reads as a receipt is moved to a fourth directory**,
  `malformed/`, with a `<file>.reason.json` beside it naming what stopped it,
  so one unreadable byte costs one row rather than 500-ing the whole listing -
  a directory the process cannot read at all still does. Temporary files an
  interrupted write abandoned are swept at startup under an hour's mtime guard,
  so a concurrent in-flight write is never deleted.
- **Both spool reads run off the event loop and are paged** behind the register
  listing's own idiom: `_count` for the page size (50 by default, 500 at most)
  and an opaque `page` cursor a client only ever gets from a `next` or
  `previous` link, with `total` the whole listing on every page of a walk and
  `/facade/spool`'s per-state counts the whole spool rather than the page. So a facade
  holding ten thousand receipts answers a page of them and pays the per-row
  projection for that page alone.
- **`GET /facade/spool` is deliberately not FHIR**, which is why it is on the
  facade's own API rather than at the base URL: it
  answers typed JSON carrying the receipt envelopes - the instant each
  submission was accepted, its form kind, its warnings, its lifecycle state,
  and the DHIS2 import report stored beside a rejection - none of which are
  QuestionnaireResponse elements.

### Sync a copy of the register

`d2w fhir sync` fills a **materialized projection**: a durable copy of the mapped
scope of a DHIS2 instance, held as the FHIR resources this project's map
publishes, on one SQLite file under the project. `[serve.search] backend =
"projection"` is what searches it. Both are opt-in, and a facade that configures
neither behaves exactly as it always has - reading the instance per request needs
no operator, no second command, and no schedule, and that stays the product.

- **The first run reads the whole mapped scope**, bulk-paged, projecting each page
  through the same `registered_entity_for` a live register read answers with -
  so a synced answer and a live one are the same bytes from the same code, and
  the only difference between them is the instant they are true as of. Measured
  on the seeded 2.43.1 stack: 502 people in about five seconds over ten pages.
- **Every run after it reads what moved**, on a `lastUpdated` cursor, and applies
  creates, updates, and tombstones. `--rebuild` drops the copy and fills it from
  zero, which is routine rather than a recovery step: it is how a change to
  `[serve.tracked_entities]` or to the published map reaches what is already
  stored. `--dry-run` reads the instance exactly as a committing run does, counts
  what would change, and writes neither a row nor a cursor.
- **`includeDeleted=true` rides every poll and is not a flag**, because its
  absence is silent - a sync without it never learns that anybody left and does
  not error. A tombstone removes the row rather than archiving a last state,
  because DHIS2 answers 404 to a read of a deleted entity, so there is no final
  state to archive. DHIS2 2.42.6 refuses the type-scoped read that carries the
  flag (BUGS.md #116); the poll then reads without it, the report says
  `tombstones_visible: false`, and `d2w fhir sync` prints a note.
- **The watermark is the instance's own clock and is per collection.** Tracked
  entities and enrollments carry one each - a person's `lastUpdated` does not move
  when one of their enrollments does, and an enrollment carries programme-level
  attribute values the projected resource does carry, so the enrollment poll says
  whose copy went stale and each one is re-read through the single tracked entity
  path. Events are not polled: the projected resource carries no data value, so an
  event that moved is not a change to anything held. The enrollment poll is scoped
  by programme because `/api/tracker/enrollments` accepts no other scope
  (BUGS.md 102).
- **A watermark never runs ahead of its rows.** The store writes a batch and its
  cursor in one transaction, and a walk advances its watermark only once every row
  it read is durable - so a walk that failed halfway advances nothing and the next
  run re-reads it, which the idempotent write makes free. An incremental run polls
  from the watermark less `[serve.projection] overlap_seconds`, because a poll from
  exactly the watermark drops the rows written in the instant it was reading.
- **`SyncReport` is typed and `--json` prints it whole**: the mode, created /
  updated / removed per FHIR resource type, the pages read, where each collection's
  cursor stood before and after, and the instant every answer served from the
  projection now states. The counts are read out of the projection rather than
  assumed, so a row the overlap window re-read is honestly an update.
- **DHIS2 stays the record.** No route writes the projection, no operator writes
  it, and a row that disagrees with the instance is a defect of this command whose
  fix is `--rebuild` rather than an edit. Deleting the file is supported. A capture
  still travels spool, `d2w fhir forward`, DHIS2, then the next sync, so a captured
  value appears in a synced server one sync interval after DHIS2 accepted it -
  stated rather than hidden behind a write-through.

### Serve from the synced copy

`[serve.search] backend = "projection"` moves the *finding* half of a register
search into the copy and leaves the *disclosing* half exactly where it is.

- **`_content` is the search that arrives with it** - R4's own parameter for a
  text search over a resource's whole content, matching a case-insensitive
  substring of any value a person holds. It is spelled `_content` and not `name`
  or `family` because this server does not know which of somebody's DHIS2
  attribute values is their name and will not guess; `"dhis2"` refuses the
  parameter, because an exact-match filter cannot answer it. `/metadata` declares
  it only where it is answered.
- **One indexed query replaces one tracker query per key per tracked entity
  type.** The identifier search matches exactly over the token index; the listing
  pages the copy with the same `_count` and opaque `page` pair the live listing
  uses, so a client cannot tell the backends apart by the shape of a link.
- **Every projection-served answer states the instant it is as of** - an
  `outcome` entry in the searchset, which is R4's own way for a server to say
  something about a search inside the search's answer, plus an
  `X-DHIS2W-Projection-As-Of` header beside it. A live answer states neither,
  because it is as of the moment the instance answered.
- **Who may see whom does not change.** The copy says who is on the page; each
  record is read from the instance under the credentials of whoever asked, so
  DHIS2 applies its sharing, organisation-unit scopes, and ownership rules per
  person per request. A person the copy holds and the instance will not disclose
  to this caller is on nobody's page, and `GET /{resourceType}/{id}` is a
  person-level read answered from the instance whatever the backend says.
- **A projection-served searchset states no `total`.** The copy counted its rows
  under the identity the sync ran as, and how many of them a given caller may see
  is the instance's to say one read at a time - so a count taken for somebody else
  is not offered. The Bundle keeps the same silence it already keeps when the
  instance states no count, and `_count=0` - which asks for that number alone -
  comes back with the cursor and no walk to follow.
- **What it still cannot do is cross scripts.** Finding `ສົມສັກ` from `Somsack`
  needs transliteration applied when the index is built, which arrives with a
  search-engine backend; a one-character typo finds nothing here either. The
  measurement and what closes each gap are in
  [the materialized projection](design/projection.md).

### A client for a running facade

`FacadeClient` in `dhis2w-fhir` is a typed async client for a running
`d2w fhir serve` facade: `capability`, `read`, `read_response`, `search` (over a
typed `ResourceQuery`), `resolve` by canonical, `generate`, `submit_response`
(answering a `CaptureReceipt` with the id, the location, and the warnings), and
`evaluate`. Credentials are `BearerToken`, `UsernamePassword`, or
`PersonalAccessToken`; a refusal raises `FacadeError` carrying the facade's
`OperationOutcome`.

### Embed the facade

`dhis2w-fhir-serve` publishes what `d2w fhir serve` assembles, so an application
that already runs FastAPI serves the real FHIR surface rather than a second
implementation of it.

- **The settings.** `ServeSettings.resolve(project, ...)` returns a
  `ServeInvocation`: the frozen settings, the address the process binds, and the
  profile it resolved - the credentials stay on the invocation and never reach
  the settings the app is handed.
- **The runtime.** `open_serve_runtime(settings)` is an async context manager
  over everything one facade holds - project, store, spool, register surface,
  and the CapabilityStatement `/metadata` answers with - as a `ServeRuntime`,
  with the DHIS2 client a live run reads through open for as long as it is
  entered and closed when it is left. A caller already holding an authenticated
  `Dhis2Client` hands it in and keeps owning it. `attach_serve_runtime(app,
  runtime)` writes the two names every handler reads.
- **The routers.** `serve_routers(capture=..., serve_ui=...)` answers a
  `ServeRouters` with the mount requirements as data: the FHIR routers that must
  carry `require_json_is_acceptable`, the three that answer plain JSON about the
  facade and must not, and the read catch-alls that mount after every fixed path.
  `accept_head_wherever_get_is_served` is the HEAD parity a liveness probe needs.
  `d2w fhir serve` is the first caller of all of it.
- **The UI is not on this surface.** The capture bundle and `/facade/uiconfig` exist so
  the browser can work and are reached by running the server with `[serve] ui`;
  `create_app` is the only thing that mounts them, and `UiBundleMissingError` is
  the one name of theirs the package publishes, because `create_app` raises it.

### Capture in the browser

`d2w fhir serve --ui` (or `[serve] ui`; the scaffolded `make serve` and
`make serve-live` pass it) adds a browser
capture UI at `/`, same-origin with the FHIR routes so it reads the very
endpoint it is served from with no URL to configure. It is a React 19 +
TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui app under
`packages/dhis2w-fhir-serve/frontend/`, built into the Python package and
shipped inside the wheel.

- **Every screen names the query behind it.** A screen that reads a resource
  carries a small **API** chip beside its heading, linking the FHIR query it is
  a rendering of - `/metadata` on Server, `/Questionnaire` on Forms,
  `/Questionnaire/{id}` on a form, the active tab's type on Terminology,
  `/QuestionnaireResponse/{id}` on a receipt, `/Location/{id}` on an
  organisation unit, `/{resourceType}/{uid}` on a tracked entity. The register's
  chip carries the live query, filters and all, so it opens what the table is
  the answer to. Each link carries `_format=json` and opens in a new tab, so it
  answers in the server's own format rather than meeting the 406 a browser's
  `Accept` would earn. Evaluate carries none: `$evaluate` is a POST.

#### Signing in

- **The shell reads the posture off `/metadata` before it draws a page**, because
  that is the one document open under every posture. A `none` posture renders
  nothing new; a `token` posture asks for one field and a `dhis2` posture for a
  DHIS2 username and password, in place of the page rather than over it - so the
  app never sends a request this server would answer 401 to, and a browser never
  gets the chance to open a credential dialog of its own over ours.
- **Submitting the panel asks `GET /facade/whoami` with what was typed, and holds
  nothing until the server names the caller.** A wrong password is refused at the
  prompt - "DHIS2 did not accept this username and password." under the DHIS2
  posture, "This server did not accept this token." under the other two - with
  the fields still there to try again with. A server that could not be reached
  says so in its own sentence, because credentials that were never checked are
  not credentials that were rejected. Without the check the default `write` scope
  leaves every read open, so the first thing that would refuse a wrong password
  is a submission somebody spent minutes filling in.
- **The name that is kept is the server's, never what was typed.** `/facade/whoami`
  answers the DHIS2 instance's own spelling of the username under `dhis2` and the
  claim the server read out of the token under `jwt`; the token posture names
  nobody, and the header names nobody for it.
- **The credential is the whole `Authorization` value, held in the page and in no
  browser store**: neither `sessionStorage` nor `localStorage` sees it, so a
  reload asks who this is again and a second tab signs in on its own. Under the
  DHIS2 posture it is a password anything can decode, and a page load is the
  longest it is held for; a deployment token and a JWT are held the same way. The
  one function in the app that reaches the network attaches it and records any
  401 that comes back, so a credential that goes stale after signing in - a
  password changed, an account disabled - is refused at the next read, listing, or
  submission, dropped rather than signed with again, and the prompt returns with
  the same sentence. The header names whoever is signed in and offers **Sign
  out**, which forgets the credential and the name and asks again.
- **The Server page states the posture and its scope**, off `/facade/uiconfig`'s `auth`,
  beside the `rest.security` description the conformance document carries.

#### Overview

- **Four spool counts as stat tiles**, with `Received` (the queue
  `fhir forward` drains) set at hero size and every tile linking into the
  Responses table with that lifecycle already selected via
  `#/responses?lifecycle=`.
- **A withdrawn receipt states what the instance keeps**, in the withdrawal
  record's own words - "This DHIS2 instance keeps a hidden copy of the event;
  it no longer appears in reports" - beside the instant and the event UID, and
  never the bare word "deleted". The answers stay on the page.
- **The rejected tile names the DHIS2 error code most of its receipts share**,
  counted per receipt rather than per issue, because DHIS2 states a rule once
  and then names every object that broke it.
- **The served forms beneath as quick-entry cards**, and a server-identity
  strip carrying the guide, its version, the store mode, the resource-type
  count and the declared operations.
- **Each of the three sections reads its own endpoint behind its own
  loading/error state**, so one dead read cannot blank the others.

#### Forms

- **`/forms` shelves every served Questionnaire by the DHIS2 capture model its
  `D2FormType` states**: **Data sets** (periodic reports for an organisation
  unit), **Event programs** (single events, no person registered), **Tracker
  programs** as one group per program with the registration form leading its
  stages and the enrols-a-person / records-a-visit dependency stated per group,
  and **People** - the `tracked-entity` kind, registering a person in the
  instance without enrolling them in a program.
- **People is a shelf of its own** because it is generated from a tracked
  entity type, names no program to group under and no period to report for, and
  is reportable at every published organisation unit since DHIS2 hangs no
  assignment on a type.
- **A form declaring no kind gets its own stated section**, since the facade
  refuses to capture against it. The same `catalogueForms` fold in
  `lib/catalogue.ts` shelves the organisation-units rail.
- **Every row keeps its title, question count, and id.**

#### The form view

`/forms/{id}` renders any served Questionnaire as fillable controls: the item
tree flattened into an ordered spec, one reducer over every answer, and a
control per R4 item type.

- **A three-state Switch for `boolean`** - Yes, No, or not answered - which
  becomes a two-state tick for a question the served dictionary types
  `TRUE_ONLY`, since DHIS2 stores `"true"` or nothing for one and an offered No
  would be discarded at import.
- **Numeric inputs bounded** by the `minValue` / `maxValue` extensions, each a
  text box a dozen characters wide with a numeric keypad and the digits set
  right - never `<input type="number">`, which drops what it cannot parse;
  native `date` / `dateTime` / `time` inputs whose values are completed into R4
  primitives on submit; Textarea for `text`; a Select for `choice` whose
  options are expanded by reading the bound ValueSet and the CodeSystem it
  composes; and a cmdk-backed searchable combobox for a `reference` question -
  the item type the emitter writes for a DHIS2 `ORGANISATION_UNIT` data element
  - writing `valueReference` through an answer slot of its own rather than
  through the text a keyboard writes.
- **Repeating questions** with add and remove rows.
- **A run of data elements cut by one set of category option combos renders as
  one table** - the elements are the rows, the combos are the columns, the
  answer is the cell where they meet - which is the shape DHIS2's own data
  entry uses and the difference between a screen of 14 rows and one of 56
  stacked questions. Every cell is a bordered box a count fits in, the rows are
  striped, and the whole run sits in a bordered box of its own. The categories
  the columns cut along are named once for the run, and so is anything every
  cell of it accepts; no uid is repeated inside a run, since fifty-six
  identifiers on a screen of fifty-six numbers is not where anybody looks for
  one. An element cut differently opens its own run, and an element whose cells
  are not numeric answers stays stacked.
- **How wide the cut is decides the run's shape.** Up to four combos it is the
  table above. A combo cut over two categories - `Female, under 15y` - is banded
  by whichever category has fewer options, for up to six bands and only where
  every band ends up with the same options of every remaining category; the
  banding is part of the table shape, so eight combos that band into two fours
  are still a table, one per band, each band headed by the value it stands for.
  Wider than four, the run is rows instead: each element in a box of its own with
  its name on the band across the top, one line per combo under it, wrapped into
  two column groups past about ten lines and three past two dozen, and no
  sideways scrolling at any width. Under a facet band the lines carry only the
  category the band did not name. From thirty lines the band itself offers a
  filter box and an *Unfilled only* tick, both of which hide lines from the
  screen and nothing else.
- **Reordering a category combo does not move the renderer.** A DHIS2 admin who
  swaps the categories inside a combo renames every combo in it and changes the
  order DHIS2 expands the cells in. The shape is decided from the decomposition
  the served combo vocabulary publishes - which category, which option, by uid -
  never from where a comma falls in a name, so the band axis is chosen by option
  count with the category name breaking a tie, and the bands and rows are read
  back in each category's own option order. Both spellings of one cut are the
  same screen, cell for cell.
- **Every row states what it currently adds up to.** A muted **Total** column
  closes each row of a table, and the row form states the same figure on the
  element's own band (*Total 226*, over every line it has, filtered or not).
  Both recompute as the boxes are typed in, and neither is submitted: a data
  set's own totals are DHIS2's to compute. A row nobody has typed in has no
  total rather than a zero, a blank beside a figure counts as nothing, and a box
  holding something that is not a number leaves no figure at all. A run whose
  cells are not one element cut several ways - a section of plain numeric data
  elements reaches the same shape - is drawn without totals, because adding two
  different quantities is not a figure.
- **One switch per run overrides that default** - *Show as rows* on a table,
  *Show as columns* on a list of rows - remembered per run in this browser, so a
  form reopened is drawn the way it was left. A cut no arrangement makes a table
  of offers no switch, because there is nothing to switch to.
- **The submission is the same in every shape.** Every cell keeps its own linkId
  and its place in document order, so a capture filled in as rows, as a table, or
  under a filter is the one QuestionnaireResponse the stacked drawing produced.
- **A run of scalar questions flows into as many columns as the screen has room
  for**, each control the width of the answer it takes - about sixty characters
  for free text, its natural width for a date, a dozen for a count. A narrative
  (`text`, which is what DHIS2's `LONG_TEXT` emits) keeps the full width on
  purpose, and so does a question that takes several answers or carries
  questions under it. A run renders as a table or as columns, never both.
- **`enableWhen` evaluated with full R4 semantics**: the six comparison
  operators plus `exists`, `any` / `all` behaviour, a group's conditions
  cascading to everything beneath it, and a condition on an unanswered question
  holding only for `exists=false`. A disabled item is hidden, uncounted in the
  required sweep, and has its answer cleared rather than held out of sight - a
  stale answer under a question the form stopped asking is the value DHIS2's
  own program rules exist to prevent, and forwarded it becomes a real data
  value.
- **Bounds are honoured client-side** on both the numeric and the `valueDate`
  spellings of `minValue` / `maxValue`: the hint states the range, and Submit
  refuses an answer outside it with the fact and nothing else (*137 is above
  100, the highest value this form accepts*). A box holding text the question
  cannot record at all is refused the same way (*5.5 is not a whole number,
  which is what this question records*), so an answer that would convert to
  nothing is stated rather than dropped from the submission.
- **A repeating `D2ProgramRule` declaration** is read off the form and stated
  where the form describes itself - *This DHIS2 instance enforces N more rules
  when the submission is imported* - each rule's name, what it does to a
  submission (*Warns*, *Refuses the submission*, *Works out an answer*) and its
  DHIS2 description listed behind a `details` fold with its uid and machine
  condition kept mono inside it, since a program rule is an instance-side
  expression this server can name but never evaluate. A rule whose action is
  `ASSIGN` also names the questions it computes, which are the controls that
  take no answer further down the same page.
- **Every question is labelled with the DHIS2 uid it is known by**, and a
  **Fill with test data** button reads `$generate` and pours its answers into
  the form to be edited rather than posting them blind. The seed rides beside
  the button as a box: a fill writes the drawn seed into it, the next fill asks
  for whatever it holds, and the seed rides the submission - so the receipt
  states which draw it came from and a reported bug can be drawn again.
- **The reporting period is chosen from recent periods of the data set's own
  type** - the current one and the twelve before it, eight quarters, or five
  years - each labelled for a person (*July 2026*, *Week 34, 2026 (starts Mon 17
  Aug)*) with the identifier DHIS2 keys by beside it, most recent first, opening
  on the period the draft states. **Other period** reveals the identifier box
  for any period at all, which is also what a type whose numbering carries an
  offset (`BiWeekly`, `2026WedW30`, `2026April`) gets instead of a list of
  periods DHIS2 might not have.
- **Only the Submit button submits a capture.** Enter in a text box - the period
  identifier, a question, the person search - is swallowed, because HTML's
  implicit submission would post a form somebody was still filling in and a
  receipt is permanent.
- **A coded question offering more than fifty options is searched, not
  scrolled**: the same popover, cap, and *N more match - narrow the search to
  reach them* footer the organisation-unit picker uses, matching a concept's
  display and its code alike. A real terminology binding runs to five figures,
  and a select over one mounts every row before it opens.
- **A submission keeps the `$generate` skeleton's envelope** - the `D2Period`,
  the tracked entity and enrollment - rather than deriving DHIS2 period
  arithmetic client-side, so what the page posts carries capture-valid context
  by construction. The facts written over that envelope are the person's rather
  than the server's:
- **A Reporting from organisation-unit picker** beside the combo, whose choice
  is kept for the browser tab (session-scoped, so a fresh tab starts fresh) and
  adopted by the next form that admits it, with the mismatch stated when the
  next form does not. It offers the published registry intersected with the
  form's own `D2OrganisationUnitAssignment` List, so the control cannot produce
  the capture DHIS2 refuses with `E1029`; an empty intersection says so instead
  of offering the registry. Searchable by name, uid, or DHIS2 code through the
  same rule the Organisation units tree filters by, and browsable as the
  hierarchy itself through a **Browse** mode beside the search box (units the
  assignment does not name kept as disabled context, branches it admits nothing
  in pruned away, opened on the held unit's ancestors, walked with the arrow
  keys). Pre-selected from whatever unit `$generate` drew, and rewriting
  `subject` for an aggregate or event form and the `D2OrganisationUnit`
  extension for a tracker one. The same one read of `GET /Location` feeds every
  `ORGANISATION_UNIT` question in the form below it.
- **A chosen organisation unit stands across a refill**, the rule the combo
  beside it already followed. **Fill with test data** asks `$generate` for a
  draft drawn at the chosen organisation unit - `?subject=Location/<id>` - so
  the answers refill, the choice stays, and the attribute option combo that
  comes back is one this DHIS2 instance accepts there. With nobody having
  chosen, the draw stands as it always did.
- **An attribute option combo control** for a data set or program on a
  non-default category combo: the combo the whole submission is filed under,
  expanded from
  the `D2AttributeOptionCombos` ValueSet the form declares and rendered
  UNANSWERED however the draft was drawn. `$generate` files its skeleton under
  a combo so the skeleton is postable, and adopting that pick would make every
  unread submission claim a project a random draw chose - so the page disables
  Submit with a stated reason until somebody picks one, mirroring DHIS2's own
  refusal to render a form until the combo is chosen. **Fill with test data**
  still adopts the fresh draw, because that is the server proposing a whole
  submission.
- **The combos DHIS2 takes no capture under are listed and disabled, with the
  reason on the row.** The vocabulary states each combo's calendar window
  (`dhis2-valid-from` / `dhis2-valid-to`) and its organisation-unit restriction
  (`dhis2-organisation-units`, one published `List` per restricted category
  option) on the concepts themselves, so the picker grades every option against
  the period and the organisation unit currently on the form: *Closed on
  2016-10-01*, *Not open until 2017-01-01*, *Not capturable at Njandama MCHP*.
  A choice made before the period or the unit moved under it is flagged under
  the control rather than silently kept. Options are marked rather than dropped,
  and a period type whose date arithmetic this app does not hold - the offset
  weeks, the financial years - grades nothing on the date axis, as does a
  restriction `List` this guide publishes nothing for.
- **A form this DHIS2 instance takes no capture for says so, in the server's own
  words.** Where `$generate` answers 422 - every attribute option combo
  restricted away from every organisation unit the form admits, or closed for
  the period it reports for - the page renders that refusal's reason in place of
  the *No submission context yet* block, disables the combo control and **Fill
  with test data**, and names the two selections in `fhir.toml` that would change
  it. The alternative is what a reader met before: a full capture page inviting a
  submission the instance refuses, and a Fill button whose only trace was a 422
  in the developer console.
- **A Person control on both registration kinds**, naming who the submission is
  about. **New person** by default - the minted identity, and the only option a
  compiled run offers, which says so rather than offering a search it cannot
  answer. **Find in this DHIS2 instance** is offered exactly when `/metadata`
  declares the form's own register - its `subjectType`, and where a form names
  none, the one register this run states it serves - with a `search-type`
  interaction on `identifier`, searching
  `GET /{RegisterType}?identifier=` in its bare-value form once the typing
  stops and listing each match as what the projection carries: the value of a
  unique attribute leading, the other attribute values beside it, the tracked
  entity uid last, and never an invented name, since DHIS2 states no attribute
  that means one.
- **Choosing a person** rewrites the subject to their real tracked-entity uid,
  names that person through the served `D2TEA_CS` displays on the picker cards
  rather than repeating their uid twice, writes the `D2SubjectExists` marker
  (pinned as one exported constant in `lib/patients.ts` and derived off the
  form's own canonical like every other extension url this UI writes), and
  makes every `D2EntityLevel` question read-only and cleared with the reason
  stated. That is load-bearing rather than tidy, because `fhir forward` refuses
  a submission that states its subject exists and carries an optional
  entity-level answer anyway, while a program-mandatory one rides the
  enrollment instead - DHIS2 answers `E1018` to a mandatory program attribute
  arriving on nothing, and an enrollment attribute writes the same store the
  person already carries the value in.
- **The person's existing enrollments** are listed beneath from
  `GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/enrollments`: program name where the guide
  publishes one, the status in one human spelling with `active` stated in words
  beside it, the enrolment date, the organisation unit - and a completed one
  carrying the warning that DHIS2 takes new events into it without complaint.
- **The stage form's Answering for picker** gains the same instance source
  beside its spool receipts, offering the found person's enrollments in that
  stage's own program alone, since DHIS2 refuses an event filed against another
  program's.
- **A tracker registration form gains an Enrollment block** stating what the
  submission will file: the enrollment date, the incident date where the
  program declares `D2CollectsIncidentDate`, and the client-minted enrollment
  UID.
- **The dates are drafted by the server and editable**, because a visit typed
  up on Thursday is not a visit that happened on Thursday, and an edit rides
  the envelope in the exact slot `$generate` put it. An event or stage form
  dates itself the same way through a **Visit date** control over `authored`,
  and an aggregate form through a **Reporting period** control over the
  `D2Period` `iso` sub-extension - required and period-type-aware off the
  form's own `D2PeriodType`, so it opens with the shape of its data set's
  period as the placeholder and the worked example beneath, and refuses an
  empty box and an identifier of the wrong shape before the round trip
  (`Daily`, `Weekly`, `BiWeekly`, `Monthly`, `BiMonthly`, `Quarterly`,
  `SixMonthly` and `Yearly` are checked; the offset weeks and the financial
  years spell their offset into the identifier and are accepted as typed rather
  than half-checked, with the server naming both types in its refusal). It
  keeps the drafted `type` and drops the optional range sub-extension rather
  than claim a range no client-side period arithmetic resolved.
- **The form is the authority on what it asks, and this UI states what it
  states.** The enrollment, incident and visit date controls take their labels
  from the form's own `D2DateLabels` where the instance renamed them - the
  receipt page labels the same facts from the same function, so one programme's
  "Date first seen" reads that way on both surfaces. A stage form declaring
  `D2Repeatable` says so where the form describes itself and on its row in the
  forms listing. An item's `D2Description` renders as the question's help text
  under its label and as a section's under its heading. A table of
  disaggregated cells names the DHIS2 categories its columns cut along, joined
  from the served combo vocabulary's own property declarations in DHIS2's
  declared order - nothing in this UI sorts a decomposition or a combo
  expansion.
- **A question the form marks `readOnly`** over an attribute the dictionary
  declares `generated` renders disabled with what will arrive stated ("DHIS2
  fills this in when the submission is imported, shaped `ANC-#######`"), is
  never counted among the required questions the form is waiting on, and is
  left unanswered by `$generate`. One rule held on both sides of the wire: the
  capture index carries `readOnly`, the synthesizer declines to draw for it,
  and the validator admits its absence even where the form marks it required.
- **The form screens gate their Submit on the `capture` flag `/facade/uiconfig`
  carries.** False, and a form still opens, fills, and reads, with *This server
  does not accept submissions* where the button was. Silence is read as
  receiving, so an unanswered settings read never withholds the one control the
  screens exist for.
- **A refusal is rendered issue by issue** with the severity, code, and
  FHIRPath expression the capture validator names the offending question with.

#### Responses and receipts

- **`/responses`** lists every stored receipt with the lifecycle state its file
  is in (received, forwarded, rejected), tinted by shared theme tokens,
  filterable by state or form, the state chips carrying the counts so the queue
  depth is on screen.
- **A Quarantined section above the table** states what `/facade/spool` counted as
  `malformed` and names each file with the reason the facade could not read it
  as a receipt. It is not a fifth state and has no row in the table - a
  quarantined file has no form, no answers, and no id to open - so it is said
  where a reader meets it rather than left to the API.
- **A second source under the receipts: one tracked entity in the DHIS2
  instance.** A receipt is what this server stored; a record is what the
  instance holds now, and a capture posted straight into DHIS2 leaves no receipt
  here at all - so a picker under the table finds a tracked entity by an
  identifier value and draws their events as the same unfoldable rows the
  register's record page draws, one per DHIS2 event, unfolding into the answers
  the instance holds. Register-aware: a run serving several registers offers the
  register first, named by what the instance calls the types riding it, and one
  serving a single register offers no chooser. There is no instance-wide feed
  and there will not be one - `GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/events` is
  entity-scoped as a security boundary - so the section is a picker by
  construction. It is drawn only where `/facade/uiconfig` reports
  `tracked_entities.events`, which a compiled run and a run switching the record
  off both report false; the empty receipts table is worded to match, stating
  the spool rather than claiming the project holds nothing.
- **`/responses/{id}`** is a deep-linkable receipt page opened by clicking a
  row: the answers joined to the questions the served Questionnaire asks, in
  that form's order, each with its enclosing groups (what turns a disaggregated
  cell from `Fixed, <1y` into `Immunization / BCG doses given - Fixed, <1y`),
  its link id, and its value rendered as what it is - a coding keeping both
  display and the code DHIS2 stores, a boolean as Yes or No, a repeating
  question showing every answer, an organisation-unit answer named off the
  served `Location` when the stored reference carries no display, which is what
  turns a bare reference into the place it names - read in both spellings, so an
  answer naming `<registry canonical>/Location/<uid>` resolves to its name and
  its hierarchy link exactly as `Location/<uid>` does. The receipt's own
  capture-context organisation unit is resolved the same way.
- **A capture-context grid** merges what the spool derived with what the stored
  resource carries, so a fact reaching it from both sources is stated once -
  which is how a registration receipt states its enrolled-at and incident
  dates, the two the spool has no column for, beside the tracked entity and
  enrollment it minted. It degrades to link ids and values with a stated reason
  when the form has been recompiled away. The two dates read as calendar days
  and not as instants, because that is what DHIS2 holds them as: the capture
  profiles spell both as `dateTime`, so a drafted one carries an hour and a
  minute no register ever recorded and rendering it would state a precision
  nobody has. An instant that really is one - when a receipt arrived, when an
  event happened - keeps its clock.
- **Beside it**: the DHIS2 context the receipt carries, the `$generate` seed it
  was drawn from, the capture warnings, and the import report's rollup of what
  DHIS2 said about a rejection - with an `E1300` row's program rule read back
  as the rule's own name, joined client-side from the `D2ProgramRule` list on
  the served form (the uid taken off DHIS2's own *Generated by ProgramRule
  (`uid`)* sentence, never off the row's `subject`, which on an `E1300` is the
  data element the rule read; a rule the served form does not list stays
  unnamed rather than guessed at).
- **A collapsible raw view** of the stored QuestionnaireResponse, reloaded on
  demand, on window focus, and on every in-app arrival at the listing, because
  the forwarder moves files under an open page. Nothing polls, so a window left
  open and unfocused shows what it last read until it regains focus.

#### Terminology browser

- **A listing per type** over all three terminology types, carrying each
  artifact's id, the DHIS2 identifiers it was generated from, and its concept
  or mapping count, with one filter narrowing all three at once. The filter
  lives in the address bar, so a narrowed listing is an address and the browser's
  Back button brings the search back; a row whose own codes matched opens the
  artifact already showing them.
- **`/terminology/{resourceType}/{id}`** shows, for a CodeSystem, every concept
  with one column per declared property, headed by the property code as words
  with the declared description as the header's tooltip - the DHIS2 option code
  beside the concept code standing for it, the category a combo splits over
  beside the combo itself.
- **Any property valued as a `Coding` into a published CodeSystem** renders as
  a link to that CodeSystem's own page with the concept filter preset to the
  coded concept. Generic to every coding-valued property, which is how a
  category option combo digs down into the category options it was met from.
- **The concept filter lives in the address bar** so the one row is
  deep-linkable, filtered client-side and paged at 200 rows for the systems
  that run to thousands.
- **A ValueSet expands through the CodeSystems it composes**, because the
  facade publishes no `$expand`; a ConceptMap shows every mapping one table per
  group with its target code and equivalence.
- **A `$translate` tester on the pages that have an answer to give** - a
  CodeSystem some served ConceptMap names as a group source, and every
  ConceptMap - asking the running server about a typed or clicked concept code
  and rendering the `Parameters` as match rows or the not-found message. A
  system no map translates from carries neither the tester nor the per-row
  button, because every press would be a refusal. A row of a map's group asks in
  that group's direction; a concept row asks every map. The button is pinned to
  the right edge of the table's own scroll box, and an ask brings the panel to
  the reader.

#### Organisation units

`/organisation-units` folds `GET /Location` into the reporting hierarchy.

- **A lazily expanded tree over `partOf`**: children rendered only when a node
  is open, a filter that keeps the ancestors of every match so a matched
  facility is never shown detached, and a unit whose parent the project never
  published shown as a flagged root rather than dropped. The count in the panel
  header says what the filter matches while one is on - *12 of 1,332
  organisation units match* - because it sits above the tree and is read as a
  count of what is on screen.
- **Three resizable panes on wide viewports**, in a GIS tool's shape: the tree,
  the map as the always-visible centre canvas, and a collapsible inspector rail
  that opens on selection. Narrower viewports fall back to two columns with the
  selection's sections behind tabs, Map the default.
- **The rail opens with the selected unit's own identity**: its level off the
  `D2OrganisationUnitLevel` coding rather than a count of `partOf` hops, its
  DHIS2 uid and organisation-unit-code identifiers, and its parent chain as
  clickable breadcrumbs.
- **Which forms may be captured there**, shelved by DHIS2 kind as **Data sets**,
  **Programs** (a tracker program's registration and stages grouped under the
  program), and **Tracked entity registration** - the `tracked-entity` kind,
  which registers whatever a project tracks and is a Focus area as often as a
  Person - with the assignment join in DHIS2's own vocabulary: the forms
  assigned to this organisation unit badged and the ones assigned everywhere
  listed plainly, because a form carrying no `D2OrganisationUnitAssignment` is
  assigned everywhere and badging all of them at every unit would bury the one
  that is not. What a missing badge means is said once under the shelves, and
  every row keeps its link out beside its own title rather than at the far edge
  of the rail.
- **Captured here**: the spool receipts naming the unit - lifecycle counts, the
  five most recent linked to their pages, a descendant rollup worded on what is
  above it (*3 captures below this organisation unit* where nothing names the
  unit itself, *3 more below* where something does), and the stated scope,
  captures this server received rather than what DHIS2 holds.
- **Children**: the subtree as a mini tree that re-roots on selection.
- **A MapLibre GL JS map** renders every decoded boundary and point over raster
  basemap tiles.
- **`[serve.basemaps]`** is an ordered list of named `{z}/{x}/{y}` layers,
  defaulting to one OpenStreetMap entry, with `basemaps = []` for the
  self-contained boundary-only canvas and repeatable `--basemap Name=url` /
  `--basemap none` overriding per run. The UI reads it from a typed
  `GET /facade/uiconfig` endpoint carrying only what the browser may know.
- **A layers control** in the corner stack lists each configured layer plus
  **None** and swaps the raster source in place on a choice, so the camera, the
  selection, and the popup survive a switch and the boundaries restyle for the
  ground they land on. Tiles are muted per ground through `raster-brightness-max`
  / `-contrast` / `-saturation` / `-opacity` so they read as ground rather than
  glare, with MapLibre's own attribution control fed the OpenStreetMap credit
  the tile policy requires - and no credit invented for a source the server
  cannot know the terms of.
- **The GeoJSON is decoded out of the base64 `location-boundary-geojson`
  attachments**, which are DHIS2's own `geometry` field and therefore hold a
  Polygon for a district and a Point for a facility. Both are drawn, with
  `Location.position` winning the dedupe when a unit states its coordinates
  twice, leaving the unreadable count for payloads that are genuinely neither.
- **The selection is lit in amber**: a two-hue encoding, the `--map-selection`
  pair against the identity-coloured subtree wash over a neutral context tier,
  with the colours read from the live CSS custom properties so the map is the
  same product in every theme and on both grounds, and a surface-coloured
  casing under each stroke so
  the ramp keeps its validated contrast over a busy basemap.
- **A zoom-aware click model**: a left-click on a shape opens a popup naming
  the unit, its level, its parent, and what sits below, with an Open action
  selecting it - or eases a step in toward the pointer while the map is still
  too far out for the click to have meant one shape. A right-click drills
  straight to the selection whatever the zoom, the point outranking the
  boundaries under it where shapes stack.
- **Corner controls** for fullscreen, a globe projection toggle that hangs the
  sphere in a deterministic starfield, and a recenter button back to the
  selection's extent or the whole registry's. The map grows into whatever
  height the page has left with a floor rather than sitting in a fixed box, and
  the whole route is lazy-loaded so the ~930 kB renderer is fetched only when
  the browser is opened.
- **The selected unit rides the query string**
  (`#/organisation-units?unit=<uid>`) so a unit is a link that can be sent. A
  unit with no geometry of its own is framed by a stated priority - the union
  of its subtree's shapes, else the nearest located ancestor, else the whole
  registry - with a caption naming which. A registry with no coordinates at all
  hides the map panel behind one sentence, and tiles that fail to load leave
  the painted ground behind them.
- **One organisation unit published as two Locations** - the registry instance
  and the curated profile exemplar a generated IG ships beside it, both
  claiming the same uid - is deduplicated by that identifier in favour of the
  instance the hierarchy hangs off, so a root is never listed twice. The server
  answers no exemplar in the first place, on the guide's own word about which of
  its instances are examples; this is the screen's guard against a guide that
  states nothing, and the count the page shows is what `GET /Location` answered.

#### Tracked entities

On a live run that serves them, `/tracked-entities` is a page over the register
the instance holds, headed by the register's own name where one type is served:
an identifier search and a paged listing on one page, with a detail route at
`/tracked-entities/{resourceType}/{uid}`.

- **What is being searched for rides the query string** (`?q=<value>`), the way
  the selected organisation unit does - so a search is a link that can be sent,
  reloaded, and arrived at from elsewhere. The command palette is the first
  thing to arrive from elsewhere: it hands the value over rather than running a
  search of its own. Typing into the box replaces the entry rather than pushing
  one, so Back leaves the page instead of unwinding the keystrokes.

- **Gated into the navigation** by the `tracked_entities` block `GET /facade/uiconfig`
  carries beside the `capture` flag - `enabled`, `listing`, `events`, and
  `registers` - all of them effective rather than as written, so a compiled run
  reports false and no entry is drawn. `events` is what the Responses page's
  record picker is drawn from, so a run answering no record draws no picker.
- **A link to a register this run does not serve is answered where it was
  opened.** The address states one card carrying the server's own refusal, read
  off `GET /{resource}` - *this facade serves a compiled implementation guide,
  so it holds no register to search; run `d2w fhir serve --live` to search
  one*, or the `fhir.toml` key a project turned the register off with, which it
  names - two different things to do about it. Neither the listing nor the record silently exchanges the address
  for the overview.
- **The words follow the tracked entity types, never the FHIR resource.** A
  guide maps whatever a project tracks onto whatever resource fits, and
  `Patient` is the fallback for a subject FHIR has no resource for - so a
  register served as `Patient` routinely carries a *Focus area* and a *Malaria
  Entity* beside the people. A register is worded as people only where every
  type riding it is a Person; narrowed to one type it speaks that type's own
  name (*Open the Focus area identified by MGC694579*, *Showing 11 of 11 Focus
  area tracked entities this DHIS2 instance holds*, never a pluralised DHIS2
  name); anything else says *tracked entity*. The listing, the section, and the
  record read one rule, so the record of a Focus area cannot call it a person
  under a badge that says otherwise.
- **`registers`** is the published `D2TET_CM` read for a screen: one entry per
  served FHIR resource with the tracked entity types riding it under the
  instance's own names, so the navigation entry and the page heading alike read
  the instance's own name for the one type a run serves - *Person*,
  *Fridge*, *Specimen batch*, singular and unpluralised because the
  string is DHIS2's - and **Tracked entities** once more than one type rides,
  never the FHIR resource this project projects a person onto. A section is
  titled *Specimen batch* rather than `Specimen` on the same rule.
- **A register over several tracked entity types offers the choice between
  them.** A chip group above the table - **All**, then one per type under the
  name `/facade/uiconfig` states for it - narrows the listing, the search, and the
  address at once: the reads carry `_tag=<uid>`, R4's own token search over the
  `meta.tag` a served register resource states its type in, and the address
  carries `?type=<uid>` beside `?q=`, so a narrowed register is a sendable link.
  A register serving one type shows no chips. Choosing one starts the paging
  again at the server's first page, because a page token names a place inside a
  scope.
- **A register can be asked which of its entities hold an attribute value.**
  `/facade/uiconfig` states the attributes `d2-attribute` answers over per register,
  with the DHIS2 value type of each and the ValueSet a coded one draws from; the
  control beside the type chips picks one of them and takes its value - a choice
  over the published vocabulary where one is bound, a date or number or plain
  box otherwise - and sends `d2-attribute={uid}|{value}` on the listing and the
  identifier search alike. A coded value goes on the wire as the `dhis2-code`
  the published concept carries, which is what the instance holds, rather than
  as the concept code, which is an option uid. The pair rides the address as
  `?attribute=<uid>|<value>` beside `?q=` and `?type=`, so a filtered register
  is a sendable link, and the control says what the server documents: the match
  is exact, ignoring case, and part of a value is not a match.
- **Each row carries what the projection states and no name column**, since
  DHIS2 states no attribute that means one. Every attribute the people on the
  page hold a value of gets a column of its own, named once in the header with
  the value alone in the cell; the attributes the published `D2TEA_CS` marks
  `display-in-list` lead - DHIS2's own answer to which values let a clerk
  recognise somebody - and inside each half the order is the dictionary's own,
  with an attribute it never published sorted after every one it did, by uid.
  That order is a property of the register rather than of the page, so the five
  columns are the same five on every page of a walk; the cap's remainder is
  stated under the table and shown in full on the record.
- **A column nothing on the page fills is not drawn.** The identifier column
  goes when no row carries a value of a unique attribute, rather than standing
  full of dashes; the tracked entity type column is drawn only while several
  types are on screen, since one type on every row is the page's own title
  stated once per record.
- **The detail keeps showing everything**, heads itself with the tracked entity
  uid only once, and drops the badge beneath when no unique value names the
  record. A total is shown only where DHIS2 stated one. The record carries the
  subject's identifiers, attribute values in the same proportional face the
  listing sets them in, its enrollments with a completed one warned (BUGS.md
  70), and what it has been through: `GET /facade/tracked-entities/{uid}/events` read
  as one row per DHIS2 event, named by the published title of the stage form it
  answered, with the date DHIS2 dates it - and the register's own words for an
  instance holding none.
- **A run that answers no record draws none.** `[serve.tracked_entities] events
  = false`, and a compiled run, leave the events out of the record and out of
  the quick view the listing opens - no heading and no refusal prose, the way
  the Responses page's own record section is absent on the same run - and
  nothing is read for them. The summary line then counts the enrollments alone,
  since "0 events" would be a count of a surface this server does not offer.
- **The summary line waits for the reads it counts.** A read that has not landed
  is in flight rather than an answer of none, so the bar under a record says
  nothing until every half of it is known - never "0 enrollments - 0 events"
  over rows the next paint fills in - and a half the server refused is left out
  rather than counted as nought.
- **An event unfolds in place into what it recorded.** Every row of the record
  opens onto its own answers, closed to start with and opened where it stands -
  no second page and no second read. The answers keep the nesting the served
  document states, so a value stays inside the section its question was asked
  in; each question is named the way the served form asks it and keeps its link
  id in mono when no served form declares it; each answer is drawn as what it
  is, a coding standing as the display a person reads beside the code DHIS2
  stores. An event the instance holds no answer on says so.
- **A search this server refused leaves the page of everything standing.** The
  box states the refusal; the listing under it is not taken away, because a
  reader whose search failed is left with a blank page and nothing to go back to
  but clearing what they typed.
- **Only the matched entries of a searchset become rows.** R4 lets a server
  append entries beside its results, and the projection backend appends an
  `outcome` one; an entry stating `search.mode` of anything but `match` is
  never a row and never counted, while an entry stating no mode at all is a
  match by omission, which is what R4 says it is.
- **The searchset's own outcome becomes the page's as-of line.** A projection-
  served answer carries `X-DHIS2W-Projection-As-Of` beside an OperationOutcome
  saying the same thing in prose, so the instant is taken from the header and
  said once, in the wall clock every other instant on every other page is read
  in - *Answered from the synced copy of this DHIS2 instance, as of ...* The
  outcome's own sentence is what answers for a copy nothing has filled yet, and
  a facade that asks DHIS2 itself states no line at all, because there is
  nothing to say about an answer read a moment ago.
- **The search box sends the parameter `/metadata` declared for that register.**
  `identifier` is what every live facade publishes and what the box has always
  sent. A run keeping a synced copy of the instance declares `_content` beside
  it, and the box then searches that instead - any part of any value a record
  holds, upper and lower case alike - with its own label and its own sentence
  about what it searches, so a blank result never means something the copy on
  screen did not describe. Neither wording calls anything a name: DHIS2 states
  no attribute that means one, which is why the server spells the parameter
  `_content` rather than `name`.

#### Playground

- **`/playground`** sends one request to this server and shows exactly what
  comes back: a method (`GET` or `POST`, the two the facade answers), a path
  relative to the service base, query parameters as rows, and a JSON body in
  the same CodeMirror editor the Evaluate screen writes expressions in. The
  address the three add up to is printed under the builder, so what **Send**
  would send is never a guess. Every request is same-origin, carries
  `Accept: application/fhir+json`, and is signed with the credential this
  browser already holds - there is one network path in this UI and this page
  uses it.
- **The presets are the CapabilityStatement read back as addresses**: one search
  per resource type declaring a `search-type` interaction, the read-by-id shape,
  and one row per declared operation - `$generate` on Questionnaire,
  `$translate` on ConceptMap, `$evaluate` at the service base as a POST carrying
  a runnable body. The page reads one Questionnaire and one mapped concept off
  the server so those three rows answer on the first press instead of carrying a
  `{id}`; where the guide publishes neither, the row says the placeholder has to
  be replaced. Choosing a row fills the builder and never sends it.
- **The answer is the status, the round trip, and the body** in the read-only
  block the receipt and Server pages render JSON in. An `OperationOutcome`
  arrives in that same block under the status the server gave it, because on
  this facade a refusal is a resource saying why; a request nothing responded
  to says so in its own words instead.
- **Two ways out of the browser**: **Open in a new tab** takes a `GET` to its own
  address with `_format=json` appended, and **Copy as curl** writes the current
  request as a single-quoted command that survives a query string, a JSON body,
  and an expression carrying its own quotes. Where this browser is signed in the
  command names the `Authorization` header and its scheme with a placeholder in
  place of the credential, so a command pasted into a ticket carries no secret.
- **The last twenty requests this browser sent** - method, address, status -
  kept in the browser's own storage behind guarded reads and writes, each row
  putting the whole request back in the builder, query rows and body included.

#### Server page and links out

- **`/server`** renders `/metadata` in full: declared operations including
  `$translate` and `$generate`, per-type interactions and search parameters,
  and the store mode - with the conformance document itself behind a **Raw
  CapabilityStatement** toggle, since this document is the facade's whole
  contract and the tables above it show the parts a browser needed.
- **Links out to the DHIS2 instance the guide was generated from**: a new-tab
  external-link mark beside the selected organisation unit's name, on every
  data set / program / program-stage row of the rail's form shelves, and on
  every concept row of the data-element dictionary. Each opens that object's
  own page in the instance's Metadata Management app
  (`{base}/dhis-web-metadata-management/index.html#/{collection}/{uid}`, where
  the collection is the plural of the object's type - `dataElements`,
  `dataSets`, `programs`, `programStages`, `organisationUnits` - each driven
  against a running 2.43.2), with `rel="noreferrer noopener"` and an accessible
  name stating which object and where it goes.
- **The address is the base url of the profile the serve run resolved**, served
  on `/facade/uiconfig` with any userinfo stripped - so a run that resolved no profile
  carries no links at all, rather than a link that goes nowhere.

#### Metadata health

- **`/facade/metadata-health` is the `d2w fhir validate` analysis rendered over the
  served selection**, off a `GET /facade/metadata-health` endpoint that reruns the
  validator over the connection the process already holds - the same passes, the
  same graders, and the same sentence per finding, so one defect read in a
  terminal and read in a browser is one defect.
- **Live runs only, and a compiled run is told why.** The endpoint answers on
  every run: a process with no DHIS2 instance behind it answers
  `available: false` with the reason in words, because "there is nothing here to
  check and here is why" is a state a screen renders rather than a status code it
  has to interpret. `/facade/uiconfig` carries the same fact as
  `metadata_health.enabled`, so the navigation entry is drawn only where the page
  has something to show.
- **Findings are shelved by severity first and DHIS2 collection second**, each
  row naming the object and its uid, the DHIS2 field at fault, the problem, and
  what the grade costs - the build stops, the published resource is degraded, or
  the object is outside what this project publishes. The problem is the
  validator's sentence less the head it opens with: a terminal line has to name
  its subject, and a row whose first two cells are the object and the field would
  be saying it a third time.
- **The page opens as a summary.** The severity counts and the per-locale
  coverage meters are what a reader meets; every table under them is closed, and
  each closed heading states its severity, its DHIS2 collection, and how many
  rows are behind it. The one filter box narrows the findings and the translation
  lists together and holds every section open while anything is typed.
- **Translation coverage is the analysis the command does not do, and it is
  coverage rather than deficiency.** The locales are the union of the tags the
  selection's own translations carry, read one bounded request per resource kind
  rather than one per object and with no system-settings read. Each locale is
  told through whichever side of it is the shorter list: below half the
  selection's translatable strings it is sparse and the page names the objects
  that carry it, stating no absence at all; at or above half it is a majority
  locale and the page names the objects nobody has written it for yet. An
  English-main instance holding three Spanish translations reads as three Spanish
  translations, not as thousands of missing ones.
- **No absent translation is graded.** Nothing about a translation is a finding
  or a warning anywhere on the page or in the payload - the severity tiles count
  the validator's own grades, and the validator grades names and codes.
- **Reporting only.** Nothing on the page writes to DHIS2 and nothing offers to;
  acting on a finding is a near-term roadmap item.

#### Command palette

- **Cmd+K on macOS, Ctrl+K everywhere else**, plus a magnifying-glass button in
  the header for anyone who was never told about the chord. Every chord this app
  binds sits on a letter, because one over the bracket, brace, pipe or backslash
  keys is one a Nordic keyboard cannot press without Alt - and no row in the
  palette carries a chord of its own.
- **Pages, forms, receipts, the register, appearance, the view, help, and the
  session**, on shelves in that order. The pages are the shell's own navigation table mapped
  onto the palette, so what the rail offers and what the palette reaches cannot
  drift; the forms are every published Questionnaire by title with its served id
  beneath; the receipts are the newest few at rest and the ones a typed id
  **prefix** names, capped, because an id is what a forward run prints and what
  somebody has in hand.
- **A register lookup hands its value to the register page in the URL**
  (`#/tracked-entities?q=...`) rather than running a search of its own, under
  the register's own threshold - so which parameter this server answers and how
  long to wait for the typing to stop stay decided in one place, and the result
  is a link that can be sent. The register page reads the value out of the query
  string, and writes what is typed into it back with `replace`.
- **Each row is one line**: a leading icon by kind, the name, the line about it
  beside rather than beneath, and the kind itself - *Page*, *Form*, *Receipt*,
  *Theme* - at the far edge. A footer bar states what the key under the reader's
  finger would do to the highlighted row (*Open*, *Switch*, *Run*) and spells the
  chord, which is where somebody who opened it by button first learns there is
  one.
- **Nothing in it changes what the server holds.** Every action navigates,
  repaints, lays the screen out, or ends the session; submitting, forwarding, and
  withdrawing all stay on their own screens.
- **It reads nothing until it is opened.** The Questionnaire search runs once
  per tab (a served guide cannot change under a running server) and the spool is
  re-read on each open, over whatever the last read produced - so the rows are
  there instantly and no page load carries the cost.
- **The action list is a pure function** (`lib/palette.ts`) of what this run
  offers, so the claim that the palette reaches every page is asserted rather
  than believed.

#### Settings, and the keys

- **One gear at the foot of the sidebar opens a settings dialog**, not a menu: a
  section rail down the left, the selected section filling the right, and a
  search box at the top of the rail that filters the rows of every section at
  once and moves to the section holding the hit. **Appearance** carries the seven
  themes under **Theme** and the light or dark ground under **Mode**;
  **Keyboard shortcuts** carries the list `?` puts up. A choice applies the
  instant it is made and the dialog stays open in front of it. The header keeps
  the collapse control, the page's name, who is signed in, and the server light,
  and carries no appearance control. Collapsed to icons the gear stays where it
  is, with the tooltip every rail entry has; on a narrow screen the section rail
  lies down into a strip above the pane.
- **The rail is a tab list and the pane its panel**, so one tab stop reaches it,
  the arrows walk it, and the section a reader is in is announced. The section
  asked for is the one selected and its tab is what takes focus - `?` and the
  palette's own row open the dialog on the keys, the gear opens it on the
  appearance.
- **`?` puts every key this app answers on screen**, matched on the character
  rather than on a physical key plus Shift, because a `?` is Shift and the slash
  on one layout and Shift and the plus on another. It never fires while an input,
  a textarea, a select, a rich-text region, or a CodeMirror editor has focus.
- **Cmd+B on macOS, Ctrl+B everywhere else, collapses the sidebar** and puts it
  back - the platform's own modifier rather than either, because Ctrl+B on macOS
  is the "back one character" that text fields and CodeMirror both answer. It
  fires while a box or an editor has focus, since clearing the screen is worth
  most mid-form, and stands aside only for a rich-text region.
- **The list is `lib/shortcuts.ts` and the rules are pure functions** over a
  described key press, so "not while somebody is typing" and "which modifier on
  which platform" are asserted rather than buried in an effect. Both chords are
  palette rows as well.

#### Themes

- **Seven designed themes, each complete on both grounds**: **Clinical** (the
  default - near-achromatic surfaces and one clinical blue), **Indigo** (deep
  blue surfaces under a violet identity), **Paper** (warm surfaces and an ink
  blue), **Contrast** (the widest separation between text and its surface),
  **Terminal** (phosphor green, and a ground to match), **DHIS2** (steel-blue
  chrome over the familiar gray), and **FHIR** (warm white under the flame).
- **Theme and mode are two axes and stay two controls.** next-themes owns light
  or dark as a `dark` class; `lib/theme.ts` owns the theme as `data-theme` on the
  same element. The settings dialog's Appearance section carries the two under
  their own headings, and the palette carries both on its Appearance shelf.
- **Applied before the first paint** by an inline script in `index.html` reading
  the same `localStorage` key the module writes, so a reload never flashes one
  theme under another. The two copies of the theme-name list are kept in step by
  a test that reads `index.html`.
- **Every theme states the whole palette** - surfaces, identity, the spool's
  lifecycle colours, and the `.tok-*` source colours the CodeMirror editors are
  painted from - hung off `html[data-theme]` for the light ground and
  `html.dark[data-theme]` for the dark one, so the dark block outranks its light
  sibling by specificity rather than by source order. A unit test reads
  `index.css` and fails a theme that leaves a token behind; a Playwright case
  paints every token pair into a canvas and puts it through the WCAG contrast
  formula, on every theme and both grounds.
- **Geometry is not a theme axis**: no theme redeclares `--radius`, so the whole
  surface still rescales from one number.
- **Terminal moves one status colour and says so**: its identity is the phosphor
  green, so `forwarded` and `completed` become a cyan rather than share the
  identity's hue with `received`. Every other theme keeps the lifecycle colours
  unchanged, and `--map-selection` stays a second hue category from every identity so a selected
  organisation unit is never a stronger shade of the wash beneath it.
- **The organisation-unit map follows both axes.** It watches `<html>` for the
  class and the attribute, and rebuilds its layers from the tokens on either -
  a theme change repaints the boundaries with nothing reloaded.

#### Mounting and coverage

- **The bundle mounts in two pieces around the router table**: its asset tree
  ahead of the read catch-alls that would otherwise claim `/assets/<file>`, its
  shell after everything - so no FHIR path is shadowed and an unserved resource
  type is still an OperationOutcome rather than a page.
- **Routing is hash-based**, so a reload needs no SPA fallback.
- **`--ui` without a built bundle refuses in one line** naming
  `make ui` rather than serving a blank page.
- **Every `--ui` run names the bundle it serves**, from the stamp `make ui`
  writes into it: the build time and a fingerprint of the frontend source that
  build read. In a checkout the stamp is graded as well as printed, so a bundle
  older than the source beside it refuses rather than serving JavaScript the
  checkout has moved past; an installed wheel carries no frontend source and is
  never graded. `make install` builds the bundle where `pnpm` is on PATH and
  says so where it is not, so an API-only install still needs no node.
- **Covered by vitest unit tests** over its wire layer and by a Playwright
  suite (`make e2e-frontend`) that boots a real `d2w fhir serve --ui` on its
  own port over a fixture IG project and drives the capture loop end to end
  twice: at the API level (`$generate`, post, the receipt appearing on the
  Responses page) and through the renderer (open the form, fill with test data,
  submit, land on the listing).
- **The documentation images are produced, not curated**: `make screenshot`
  builds the bundle and runs two skipped-by-default producer specs into
  `docs/img/fhir/` - one over the fixture project from stated seeds, and, where
  `D2W_SCREENSHOT_PROJECT` names a project, one over its own
  `d2w fhir serve --live` for the three surfaces a compiled guide cannot draw
  (Metadata health, a tracked entity's record, and the record under the
  Responses table). The live shoot serves a copy of the project's `fhir.toml`
  with the spool pointed at a temporary directory, and only ever reads.
### Forward captures into DHIS2

`d2w fhir forward` is the third verb, and it closes the loop
IG -> form -> QuestionnaireResponse -> DHIS2. It reads the receipts out of
`.serve/responses/received/` and drains them.

#### Translation context

- **Assembled from the very artifacts the facade serves**: the compiled
  `ig/fsh-generated/resources` merged with the predefined `ig/input/resources`
  tree.
- **Or, for a project holding no compiled guide**, the same documents built off
  the instance through `fetch_live_artifacts` - the forward-side twin of
  `serve --live`, reading one metadata pass through the same builders - so a
  receipt captured with no build step drains with none. The absence of the
  compiled tree is the whole trigger, and `[forward] live = false` restores the
  refusal naming `d2w fhir generate` and `make sushi`.
- **Plus one id-only `fields=id,valueType` read** against `/api/dataElements`
  and another against `/api/trackedEntityAttributes`, for the one fact the
  compiled IG cannot carry: R4 spells `BOOLEAN` and `TRUE_ONLY` as the same
  `#boolean` item type.

#### Translation

Each response goes through `dhis2w_fhir.conversion` all-or-nothing.

- **An aggregate envelope** carries all three DHIS2 keys, with its
  `attributeOptionCombo` resolved off the response's `D2AttributeOptionCombo`
  coding against the vocabulary the form declares, on the same concept-code /
  `dhis2-id` / ConceptMap tiers a coded answer resolves through and under the
  same lenient/strict dial. A form that declares one and a response that names
  none is refused as `missing-attribute-option-combo` rather than posted,
  because DHIS2 refuses that write itself; a combo the vocabulary does
  not hold is `unresolvable-attribute-option-combo`; a combo named against a
  form that declares none is noted and left off, since its data set or program
  rides the default category combo. Each refusal names the DHIS2 error the write
  would have earned - `E8023` on a data value set, `E1055` or `E1115` on a
  program capture.
- **A tracker registration** becomes the `/api/tracker` `trackedEntities` entry
  it creates, carrying the client-minted tracked entity UID, the tracked entity
  type the form's `$DHIS2-TET` identifier names (absent, it is refused as
  `missing-tracked-entity-type`, since a program without one cannot register
  anybody), one `TrackerAttribute` per answered tracked entity attribute
  through the same value-type serialisation and the same coded-answer dial a
  data element's answer goes through, and the single `ACTIVE` enrollment it
  mints - `enrolledAt` required (`missing-enrollment-date`), `occurredAt`
  written only where the response states an incident date, both read back to
  the zone-less wall clock DHIS2 stores, and `attributeOptionCombo` written from
  the combo the response names where the program declares a vocabulary, because
  DHIS2 checks an enrollment's combo against the program's own category combo.
- **An event of either kind** carries the DHIS2 UID derived from the receipt's
  own logical id (SHA-256 over `<response id>:event:0`, shaped by the drawer
  the synthesis path mints tracked entity and enrollment UIDs with), so one
  receipt always names one event: a dry run and the import behind it report the
  same object, and a receipt forwarded twice is refused as an object the
  instance already holds rather than filed as a second copy of one visit. It
  also carries the `attributeOptionCombo` the response names where its program
  declares a vocabulary, because DHIS2 answers `E1055` to an event of a program
  whose category combo is not the default one and which names no combo.

#### Posting

- **One payload per response**: an aggregate envelope to `/api/dataValueSets`,
  everything else to `/api/tracker` under
  `importStrategy=CREATE&async=false`, through one client opened for the whole
  run.
- **People before the payloads that create an enrollment, and those before
  everything that answers into one**, so the person a registration of the same
  drain enrols and the enrollment a stage response answers against both exist
  by the time DHIS2 reads them (`E1313` otherwise). No dependency tracking sits
  behind the ordering, and the report still reads back in spool order.

#### Dry run is the default

- **Every payload still reaches the real endpoint** under that endpoint's own
  validate-only mode (`dryRun=true` on `/api/dataValueSets`,
  `importMode=VALIDATE` on `/api/tracker`, the v42 spellings taken from the
  generated OpenAPI), so DHIS2's own rules decide each outcome while nothing is
  written and no receipt moves.
- **The terminal closes with one DRY RUN banner** naming `--import` as the way
  to commit, under the counts it explains. The summary's `mode` row names the
  posture above them, so the run states it at both ends without printing the
  same forty words twice. `d2w fhir withdraw` reads the same way.
- **`[forward] import = true`** makes the bare run of a project whose drains
  are routine commit instead, with `--import` / `--dry-run` still outranking it
  either way - flag, then table, then default, resolved in `forward_responses`
  so the CLI and the MCP tool cannot resolve it differently.
- **A dry run counts a stage event whose enrollment a registration of the same
  run creates as unverifiable** rather than rejected - it writes nothing, so
  there is no enrollment to check the event against - and gives it its own
  count and section, while a stage event naming an enrollment no registration
  of the run creates stays a rejection.
- **A DHIS2 rejection exits 1; a dry run whose only failures are unverifiable
  exits 0.**

#### What DHIS2 said

- **A DHIS2 refusal arrives as a 409** and is recorded as one response's
  outcome rather than raised as the run's, with every word DHIS2 said kept.
- **The two endpoints disagree on the shape**: `/api/dataValueSets` answers a
  `WebMessage` wrapping the `ImportSummary`, `/api/tracker` answers the
  `TrackerImportReport` bare with no envelope at all - so each family
  recognises its own report by the fields only that report carries.
- **Every row lands as a typed `ForwardImportIssue`** (`error_code`, `subject`,
  `message`) whether it came from `response.conflicts[]` or
  `validationReport.errorReports[]`, with the generated `ImportSummary` /
  `TrackerImportReport` riding alongside untouched.
- **Rejections roll up by cause** - error code plus the message with its
  identifiers generalised away, except a UID naming a program rule the guide
  published, which is read back as that rule's own name so an `E1300` refusal
  says which rule refused rather than which twelve characters did (the raw UID
  stays untouched on the response's own `.report.json`). Quoted and bare alike,
  and by the same shape test: DHIS2 backticks the organisation-unit list of an
  `E8025` and leaves the attribute option combo in the same sentence bare, so a
  row standing for three responses refused on three different combos names none
  of them rather than the first one's - while what DHIS2 quotes is not thereby an
  identifier, since an `E1302` backticks a value type, a whole explanatory clause
  and the offending value inside it. A run of characters reads as an identifier
  only when every token in it is eleven characters starting with a letter and
  turns like a UID rather than like a word - it carries a digit, or it turns from
  lower case to upper more often than a word does - so the `DataElement`, the
  `NUMBER` and the `-Infinity` of an `E1302` sentence all stay prose. Each
  response is counted once per distinct cause, so `202 rejected` reads as the
  three rules it broke, rendered as a `Responses | Code | What DHIS2 said`
  table on the terminal and at the head of the written report.
- **A cause whose responses all met it in the same words is stated as DHIS2
  stated it**, its identifiers intact - a cause that ended one response, and a
  cause that ended five byte-identical ones alike. The generalisation is what
  turns twenty rejections differing only in the object they name into one row;
  where nothing differs it removes the sentence and buys the reader nothing back,
  sending them to the report file for something that fits on the line in front of
  them.

#### The spool as ledger

- **With `--import`**, an accepted receipt is renamed into
  `.serve/responses/forwarded/` and a rejected one into `rejected/`, each
  beside an atomically written `<id>.report.json` holding its import outcome -
  a rejection needs one to say why it was refused, and an acceptance needs one
  because the import counts are what say how much of it landed, which
  `GET /facade/spool` then carries on the row as `imported`.
- **A conversion-refused receipt stays in `received/` untouched**, because the
  fix for it is in the guide or in the data and the next run is the retry -
  except the one refusal no fix could ever reach.
- **A response reporting itself `entered-in-error`** asks for a withdrawal this
  toolchain does not build, and is therefore filed to `rejected/` with a
  sidecar naming the doctrine (`TERMINAL_REFUSAL_CATEGORIES`, one explicit set
  rather than a flag on a whim; see
  [Corrections and withdrawals](design/data-lifecycle.md)) rather than translated
  again by every drain for ever. `d2w fhir requeue` is the way back for an
  operator who disagrees.
- **Each receipt is filed the instant DHIS2 answers about it** - the sidecar
  written, then the rename - inside the posting loop rather than in a pass at
  the end. So a drain that is killed halfway leaves everything it posted in
  `forwarded/` or `rejected/` with its report, and everything it had not
  reached untouched in the queue; a rename that finds the file already gone is
  graded onto the report as a lost race rather than throwing the drain and
  DHIS2's answer away.
- **One drain at a time.** A run holds an exclusive `flock` on
  `.serve/responses/.drain.lock` for its whole length with its own process id
  written inside, so a second drain of the same project fails at once naming
  the holder rather than posting every payload twice and racing its renames,
  and the kernel releases it however the run ended. `fhir serve` never takes
  it.
- **A file in `received/` that will not read as a receipt is quarantined** to
  `malformed/` with its reason and named on the report while the drain proceeds
  with the rest, and abandoned temporary files older than an hour are swept as
  the drain starts.
- **An instance that fails mid-drain** - a 5xx, or a connection that never
  completes - stops the run rather than being read as a verdict on the payload
  that met it: whatever was already posted stays filed, that receipt and
  everything behind it stay in `received/` as `not-posted`, and the report
  names what stopped it and how many were never sent.
- **The terminal states the distinction in its own closing line**: a DHIS2
  rejection points at the import summary, a translator refusal points at the
  guide.

#### Data set completeness

- **An aggregate response whose `status` is `completed` also registers data-set
  completeness**: a second write to `/api/completeDataSetRegistrations` naming
  the very `(dataSet, period, organisationUnit, attributeOptionCombo)` tuple
  the values landed under, claiming the day the response records itself
  `authored`, and made only after DHIS2 has taken the values - since a
  completeness claim about data the instance refused would be a lie.
- **`in-progress` imports its values and registers nothing.**
- **`--register-completeness` / `--no-register-completeness`** (default on,
  `[forward] register_completeness` stating it once for the project, and
  `register_completeness` on the MCP tool) turns the whole run's second write
  off. A dry run posts nothing and states the tuple it would register instead.
- **A refused registration is reported as such without un-importing the
  values**, which stay imported and are re-claimed by forwarding the same tuple
  again - DHIS2 answers a registration it already holds with `updated`, not a
  conflict.
- **Each outcome is typed on `ForwardCompletenessOutcome`** (`registered` /
  `would-register` / `not-claimed` / `not-registered` / `refused`) and rendered
  as its own terminal table, summary row, and written-report section carrying
  the four keys, because a registration has no UID to look it up by.
- **The envelope's own `completeDate` is deliberately never written**, since on
  2.42 it registers completeness even when every value was refused and even
  under `dryRun=true` (BUGS.md 76, 77).

#### Values a previous submission already sent

- **A drain names every aggregate value it sends that a forwarded receipt
  already sent**, with the receipt that sent it and when that receipt arrived.
  DHIS2 replaces such a value in place and counts the write exactly as it
  counts a first entry (BUGS.md 85), so no import summary can separate a
  correction from a first entry - the spool answers what the wire cannot.
- **The record is the sidecar.** A forwarded receipt's `<id>.report.json`
  carries the identity of every value its payload landed on - data element,
  category option combo, period, organisation unit, attribute option combo -
  and the day the receipt arrived. Identity only, never the numbers.
- **Only `forwarded/` counts**: a receipt DHIS2 refused never landed its
  values, and one still in the queue has not been sent. Receipts filed earlier
  in the same drain do count, so a drain holding two captures of one report
  says that the second replaced the first.
- **A dry run states it too**, as the prediction it is - the moment there is
  still something to be done about it.
- **`[forward] overwrites` decides what the drain does about it**, with
  `--overwrites allow|refuse` outranking it for one run - flag, then table, then
  default, resolved in `forward_responses` like the sibling dials. `allow` - the
  default - posts the value and names it, which is DHIS2's own last-write-wins
  semantics taken as a posture rather than inherited by omission.
- **`refuse` sends no payload holding such a value at all**, and refuses the
  **whole response** rather than part of it - a payload posted in part would
  tear one submission across two postures. The refusal is non-terminal: the
  receipt stays in `received/` with an `<id>.refusal.json` under category
  `overwrite-refused` naming every covered value, the receipt that sent it, and
  when that receipt arrived, so `d2w fhir spool` shows it as refused-but-queued
  with the reason and a later drain under `allow` posts it. A dry run under
  `refuse` states what it would refuse and files nothing. A refused response
  claims no data-set completeness, since its values were never sent.
- **The refused responses are counted under the run's own refused number**, and
  read apart from a translator refusal wherever the reason matters:
  `ForwardOutcome.overwrite_refused`, a `Refused as an overwrite` section of the
  written report, and a terminal note naming `--overwrites allow` as the way to
  post them.
- **The dial never reaches a tracker payload.** An event's DHIS2 identity is
  derived from the receipt's own id, so it collides rather than overwriting -
  see [Corrections and withdrawals](design/data-lifecycle.md), which
  carries the decision (D8) in full.
- **The reading is built once per drain and only when the drain carries an
  aggregate payload**, so a tracker-only run reads nothing at all. It opens
  each forwarded receipt's import report once and nothing else, and it never
  truncates or samples - a reading that quietly stopped part-way would answer
  "no earlier submission" about a value that has one.
- **Typed as `AggregateCell` / `OverwrittenValue` / `ForwardOverwrite`** on
  `ForwardOutcome.overwritten_values`, and rendered as a terminal note, a
  `--details` table, its own written-report section, and the `--json` payload.
  A receipt in `forwarded/` whose report records no values is counted on
  `forwarded_without_values` and named, rather than passed over in silence.

#### Corrections and withdrawals

The posture today, in one place, because "is this supported?" is the question
this section exists to close. The full argument and the design the remaining
slices follow are in
[Corrections and withdrawals](design/data-lifecycle.md).

- **A second capture of an aggregate report overwrites the first in place.**
  The envelope names no `importStrategy`, so DHIS2 applies its own
  `CREATE_AND_UPDATE`; the values are replaced and the report says which ones
  (above). `[forward] overwrites = "refuse"` is the deployment posture that
  leaves such a response in the queue instead of sending it.
- **A second capture of a tracker visit creates a duplicate**, because an
  event's UID is derived from the receipt's own id and every capture mints a
  fresh receipt. Re-forwarding the *same* receipt is the case DHIS2 refuses,
  with `E1030` - one receipt names one event, and that is the guarantee that
  holds.
- **`[forward] corrections` and `[forward] withdrawals` are the deployment's
  posture towards a marked submission**, where `overwrites` is its posture
  towards an unmarked one. `corrections` takes `"off"` (the default) or
  `"amend"`; `withdrawals` takes `"off"` (the default) or `"retract"`. Both
  resolve in `service.forward_responses` alongside every sibling dial - the
  flag, then `fhir.toml`, then the default - with `--corrections` and
  `--withdrawals` on `d2w fhir forward` overriding either for one run, and both
  are named in `--details` and `--json` wherever a project has turned one on.
  A drain acts on neither: it imports.
- **A project publishing forms is not thereby a project that reaches back into
  DHIS2**, which is why both default to off. Turning one on is a sentence
  somebody wrote rather than a default nobody read.
- **`d2w data tracker delete` is the raw escape hatch** for the kinds the FHIR
  path does not retract, outside it and behind a confirmation prompt, with
  `d2w data aggregate delete` beside it.

### Withdraw an event you forwarded

`d2w fhir withdraw <receipt id>...` deletes from DHIS2 the event a forwarded
receipt landed, and files the receipt under the spool's fourth state.

- **`[forward] withdrawals = "retract"` gates the whole command**, with
  `--withdrawals retract` stating it for one run. Off, the command posts
  nothing at all and the refusal names the key.
- **The identity is recomputed, never looked up.** The object deleted is
  `receipt_event_uid(<the receipt's id>)`, so a withdrawal needs no compiled
  guide, no metadata read, and no translation - which makes it answerable about
  a project captured through `d2w fhir serve --live`.
- **A dry run is the default**, exactly as it is for a drain: the delete goes
  to `/api/tracker` under `importMode=VALIDATE`, so DHIS2 answers whether it
  would take it while nothing is deleted and no receipt moves. `--import`
  commits.
- **`withdrawn/` is the spool's fourth state**, and the only one a receipt
  reaches without being posted again. The receipt file is never rewritten; a
  `<id>.report.json` holding what DHIS2 answered the delete lands beside it
  first, and the import report that recorded what it landed **stays in
  `forwarded/`** - two answers to two questions, neither rewritten.
- **Withdrawal is terminal, and the copy says what remains rather than
  "deleted".** DHIS2 burns the UID it deletes and refuses it under every import
  strategy afterwards, so a withdrawn receipt can never be forwarded again;
  what stays in the instance is a hidden copy of the event carrying its values,
  which no ordinary read returns.
- **Only a forwarded receipt that landed one event can be withdrawn**, and
  every id is checked before anything is posted. An aggregate report and a
  registration are refused by name with the kind they are - each needs a guard
  the event leg does not.
- **A delete DHIS2 refuses leaves the receipt in `forwarded/`** with the import
  report that says what it landed, names it `refused` in the run, and exits 1.
- **Typed as `WithdrawReport` / `WithdrawnReceipt` / `WithdrawalRecord` /
  `WithdrawalKind`**, with `--json` carrying the whole report, and
  `WithdrawalNotEnabledError` / `WithdrawalUnsupportedError` for the two
  refusals that are about the project rather than about DHIS2.
- **`d2w fhir spool` counts the fourth state** and reads the record of the
  delete back for the reason column.

#### Output

- **`[serve] strict_codes` is the default coded-answer dial**, so a project
  that captures strictly forwards strictly, and `--strict-codes` /
  `--no-strict-codes` overrides it.
- **The condensed terminal writes every response's outcome** to
  `reports/fhir-forward-report.md` with one counted hint, while `--details`
  prints the per-response table with a Why column carrying each response's
  first reason, and `--json` carries the whole `ForwardReport`. The written
  report's header states what the run replaced as well as what it counted.
- **The scaffolded Makefile gains `make forward` / `make forward-import`.**

### Inspect and requeue the spool

Two operator verbs sit beside the drain and touch no instance at all.

- **`d2w fhir spool`** states how many receipts wait in each state and how many
  files are in the holding pen. `--details` adds a row per receipt with the
  short reason read off the sidecar, and `--json` carries the whole
  `SpoolStateReport`.
- **`d2w fhir requeue <id>... | --all-rejected`** renames refused receipts back
  into `received/` for the next drain, leaving the import report behind in
  `rejected/` as the record of what DHIS2 last answered about that payload,
  clearing any leftover `<id>.refusal.json` in `received/` so the requeued
  receipt reads as one no drain has refused, and refusing an id that is not
  there before anything moves - so a run of five never leaves an operator
  working out which three it reached.
- **`d2w fhir spool` states four states**, `withdrawn/` beside the three the
  drain files into.
- **`--details` degrades at 80 columns rather than folding.** The form's UID and
  the sentence saying why a receipt is where it is carry a floor and an
  ellipsis, and the timestamp and the capture identity are dropped in that order
  when the terminal is too narrow for them - both are on the receipt's own file
  and in `--json`, and what is left is the id `requeue` and `withdraw` take, the
  state, the form, and the reason. 80 columns is what a non-TTY pipe gets.
- **Neither opens a client nor needs a profile**, because every fact either
  states is in the project directory, which is what makes them answerable while
  the instance is down.

### Check an instance

`d2w fhir doctor` is the conformance runner: it scaffolds a throwaway project
against the ambient profile and drives the entire chain through it in ten
typed phases.

- **connect** - version detected, plugin tree named.
- **scaffold** - a coherent probe: the first data set, the first
  WITHOUT_REGISTRATION program, and the first WITH_REGISTRATION program by
  name, plus the organisation-unit subtree those forms are actually assigned
  inside, since DHIS2 refuses a response naming a unit a form is not assigned
  to. `--all-targets` takes the lot instead. The selection is the probe's own;
  the `[generate]` posture is not. Every key that decides what a run *produces*
  rather than what it selects - `hostile_names`, the `[generate.naming]` table,
  `concept_code_source`, `identifier_system_base`, `timezone`, `locales`, and
  `tracked_entity_types` - is copied from the project doctor was run in, so the
  phases after this one answer "does the toolchain run against this instance as
  this project is configured" rather than "does it run under the scaffold's
  defaults". Run from a directory no `fhir.toml` sits in or above, the
  scaffold's own answers stand.
- **generate** - the full pipeline, every note kept as a finding, screened
  through the `[generate] hostile_names` posture the scaffold copied off the
  calling project - the same gate `d2w fhir generate` builds. A project stating
  `refuse` fails this phase on the same DHIS2 name `d2w fhir generate` exits 1
  on, and the phase's evidence states the posture it ran under so a reader knows
  which of the two answers the outcome belongs to.
- **compile** - real SUSHI when the machine offers one (`sushi` on PATH or the
  `fhir-ig` docker image the scaffold builds), and SKIPPED with that reason
  otherwise, because a compile is evidence rather than a gate every machine can
  meet.
- **validate** - the scope-aware code report folded in.
- **serve** - the store built in process, no port bound and no subprocess
  started, from the compiled guide or from the live builders written where a
  compiler would have written them.
- **capture** - `$generate` over every published form, posted straight back
  through an in-process `httpx2.AsyncClient` over the ASGI app, holding the
  endpoint to its 201 invariant, registrations before their stages.
- **forward** - the corpus drained at the real instance in validate-only mode,
  rejections rolled up by cause.
- **oracle** (`--live`) - the instance judges the served output: every served
  UID resolved back against the DHIS2 collection it names, plus a seeded sample
  per family deep-compared field by field, with the field path stated on every
  mismatch and the DHIS2 object always the authority.
- **drift** - the only phase whose subject is not the throwaway project. Run
  from a directory a `fhir.toml` sits in or above, it reads that guide's
  published artifacts off disk - the trees the served store and
  `check-artifacts` read - and names every organisation unit, option, tracked
  entity attribute, data element, and program stage the instance now holds
  inside that project's own selection scope that the guide does not, in both
  directions and on renames alike. The worked examples the guide compiled
  beside its profiles are counted and graded nowhere - which instances those
  are is the guide's own word, `definition.resource[]` of the compiled
  `ImplementationGuide`, read through the same `dhis2w_fhir.implementation_guide`
  that holds them out of what `d2w fhir serve` searches and counts. Warning-class
  throughout: a guide is out of date rather than broken, so drift never exits 1.
  Tracked entity types are
  left to `d2w fhir validate`'s `unmapped-tracked-entity-type` checklist and
  cross-referenced in one line rather than re-reported. Skipped, with the
  reason, from a directory holding no project or from a project that was
  generated but never compiled.

The instance comes from `--profile/-p` on the command, then the root `-p`, then
`DHIS2_PROFILE`, then the `fhir.toml` of a nearby project - the same resolution
`d2w fhir validate` runs, with the command's own flag ahead of it, so a shell
that names the profile after the verb is not turned down.

Each phase reports PASS / WARN / FAIL / SKIPPED / BLOCKED with a stated reason,
a failure never stops a phase that does not depend on it, and only a FAIL exits
1. The run renders a phase table, a findings table, and a verdict line on
stderr, carries the typed `DoctorReport` under `--json`, and writes
`reports/fhir-doctor-report.md` as the artifact a handover is read from.

CLI-only by design: a write-heavy orchestration with no read-only shape an MCP
tool could honestly advertise.

### Configuration

A committed `fhir.toml`, discovered by walking up from the working directory,
carries the whole project's settings. Every table of that document declares its
full key set and refuses anything else.

| Table | What it sets |
| --- | --- |
| top level | `profile` - the connection profile the project reads |
| `[ig]` | `id`, `canonical`, `name`, `title`, `publisher`, `status` |
| `[generate]` | `identifier_system_base`, `concept_code_source`, `timezone`, `locales` |
| `[generate.naming]` | `source` plus `prefix` and the eight artifact tokens |
| `[generate.option_sets]` | Terminology selection |
| `[generate.categories]` | Category selection, `include_default` |
| `[generate.organisation_units]` | `root`, `max_level`, `geometry`, `terminology` |
| `[generate.data_sets]` | Aggregate form selection, `enabled` |
| `[generate.event_programs]` | Event program selection (WITHOUT_REGISTRATION), `enabled` |
| `[generate.tracker_programs]` | Tracker program selection (WITH_REGISTRATION), `enabled` |
| `[generate.tracked_entity_forms]` | Person-only registration form selection, `enabled` |
| `[generate.tracked_entity_types]` | UID to FHIR resource type map |
| `[generate.examples]` | `per_target`, `source` |
| `[serve]` | `host`, `port`, `strict_codes`, `capture`, `ui`, `spool_dir`, `basemaps`, `tracked_entities`, `data_sets`, `search` |
| `[serve.tracked_entities]` | `enabled`, `listing`, `events`, `page_size`, `page_size_limit`, `tracked_entity_types`, `search_attributes` |
| `[serve.data_sets]` | `responses`, `page_size`, `page_size_limit`, `data_sets`, `period_limit` |
| `[serve.search]` | `backend` (`dhis2`, `projection`) |
| `[[serve.basemaps]]` | `name`, `url` - one table per raster tile source the map offers |
| `[serve.projection]` | `store` (`none`, `sqlite`), `path`, `overlap_seconds` |
| `[forward]` | `live`, `import`, `register_completeness`, `overwrites`, `corrections`, `withdrawals` |

- **An unknown key stops the command.** A misspelled `max_lvl = 4` produces
  `error: fhir.toml: unknown key 'max_lvl' in [generate.organisation_units]`
  with a `did you mean 'max_level'?` beneath it - one such line per unknown
  key, `difflib`-matched against the very names that table accepts, and no
  suggestion where nothing is close, instead of setting nothing and saying
  nothing. An array of tables answers the same way and under the name a reader
  writes: a typo in `[[serve.basemaps]]` is reported `in [serve.basemaps]`,
  without the entry's index, and matched against the two keys a tile source has.
- **Two values unset silently**: `root = ""` and `max_level = 0`.
- **Flags beat the table beats the defaults** on `[serve]` and `[forward]`
  alike, and `--strict-codes` / `--no-strict-codes` reaches all three levels.
  `[serve] capture` and `[serve] spool_dir` have no flag at all, and neither do
  `[serve.tracked_entities]`, `[serve.data_sets]`, `[serve.search]`, and
  `[serve.projection]`, because each states what the server is rather than what
  one run does.
- **The `[forward] import` key is spelled `import` in the file** (the field is
  `import_responses` in Python, because `import` is a keyword), and the file
  accepts no other spelling of it.
- **`fhir.example.toml`** carries a one-line comment per option pointing at its
  section in the guide, and the scaffolded `fhir.toml` header names both the
  example file and the series.

### Progress and output

Every `d2w fhir` command with an instance behind it narrates its steps on
stderr - a spinner on a terminal, plain `[k/N]` lines when redirected - and
takes `--progress` / `--no-progress`. Tables, notes, and progress are stderr;
stdout carries the `--json` payload alone, so `--json` implies a silent stderr.

### The library surface

Every capability behind a `d2w fhir` command is importable from `dhis2w_fhir`
itself, so an embedding application calls what the command calls. Names below are
`from dhis2w_fhir import ...`; [the API reference](api-dhis2w-fhir.md)
renders each module.

| Capability | Names |
| --- | --- |
| Generation, whole guide or one target | `generate_full`, `generate_foundation`, `generate_option_sets`, `generate_categories`, `generate_questionnaires`, `generate_examples`, `generate_organisation_units`, `generate_pages`, plus `GenerateReport` / `GenerateFullReport` |
| The build refusals | `BuildAbortingCodeError`, `BuildAbortingNameError`, and the two predicates behind them, `build_aborting_code` and `build_aborting_name` |
| The same refusal read off disk | `check_publishable_artifacts`, `ArtifactCheckReport`, `ArtifactFinding` |
| Scaffolding | `init_project`, `refresh_project`, `read_project_scaffold_state`, `ProjectScaffoldState`, `normalize_project_name`, `preserves_every_line` |
| Validation, producing a report rather than rendering one | `validate_codes`, `resolve_validation_context`, `resolve_validation_scope`, `resolve_code_source`, `ValidationContext`, `display_code` |
| The conformance runner | `run_doctor`, `DoctorOptions`, `DoctorReport`, `DoctorPhase`, `DoctorOutcome`, `DoctorPhaseResult`, `DoctorFinding`, `PhaseOutcome`, `CaptureOutcome`, `FamilyOutcome`, `resolve_doctor_profile`, `resolve_published_project`, `render_doctor_markdown`, `phase_evidence`, `generate_findings`, `drift_findings`, and the graders `grade`, `grade_capture`, `grade_forward`, `grade_oracle`, `grade_drift` |
| Drift between a published guide and the instance | `detect_drift`, `read_published_guide`, `compare_organisation_units`, `compare_option_set`, `compare_form`, `registry_scope_line`, `DriftReport`, `DriftFinding`, `DriftSubject`, `DriftKind`, `PublishedGuide`, `PublishedForm`, `PublishedOptionSet`, `PublishedObject`, `InstanceForm`, `InstanceOptionSet`, `InstanceOption`, `InstanceObject`, `DRIFT_REMEDY` |
| What a guide calls a worked example | `load_declared_examples`, `declared_examples`, `reference_key`, `DeclaredExamples`, `GuideDocument`, `PublishedResourceKey`, `ImplementationGuideContents`, `ImplementationGuideDefinition`, `ImplementationGuideResource`, `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_RESOURCE_TYPE` |
| The posture one generate run screens DHIS2 names under | `project_gate`, `HostileNameGate`, `HostileRewrite`, `HostileRewriteConfirmation`, `HostileNamePosture` |
| Translating a captured response into DHIS2 | The whole `dhis2w_fhir.conversion` surface, name for name: `translate_response`, `translate_responses`, `build_conversion_context`, `build_project_context`, `load_compiled_artifacts`, `ConversionContext`, `ConversionResult`, `ConversionReport`, `ConversionPayload`, `ConversionTargetKind`, `ConversionRefusal`, `ConversionNote`, and the rest |
| Refusal records on the spool | `record_refusal`, `read_refusal_record`, `ForwardRefusalRecord`, `RefusalReason`, `SPOOL_RELATIVE_PATH`, `REFUSAL_RECORD_SUFFIX`, `QUARANTINE_REASON_SUFFIX`, `DRAIN_LOCK_FILE_NAME`, `ORPHAN_TEMPORARY_FILE_AGE_SECONDS` |
| The profile a run resolves | `GenerationProfile`, `resolve_generation_profile` |

- **Every capability that reads DHIS2 takes the connection as an argument.**
  `client=` on `validate_codes`, `run_doctor`, `forward_responses`, and each
  generate target, with the `Profile` form kept as the convenience wrapper the
  commands use. A handed-in client is used as it stands and left open - its
  lifetime belongs to whoever entered it - so an application already holding an
  authenticated connection makes one connection rather than one per call.
  `fetch_live_ig_inputs` and `fetch_live_artifacts` have always taken one.
- **`run_doctor` states what it does to the machine** in its own docstring: it
  mints a workspace, shells out to `sushi` or `docker run`, writes compiled
  resources, runs an ASGI application in process, and posts a synthetic corpus
  under validate-only mode. The graders are pure and callable without any of it.
- **A test asserts the surface.** `test_fhir_package_surface.py` parses the
  `:::` directives out of `docs/api-dhis2w-fhir.md` and fails when a module
  the API reference renders exports a name the package does not, so the docs and
  the imports cannot drift apart quietly.
  `test_fhir_conversion_surface.py` holds the conversion layer to the same claim
  from the other side: every name `dhis2w_fhir.conversion` states it exports is
  on the package root and is the same object, so a caller reads one import path
  rather than guessing which names were re-exported and which were not.

### No MCP tools

The surface is CLI-only, and the plugin registers nothing on the MCP server.
Most of it could be nothing else - scaffolding, every generate target, and
`doctor` write a file tree onto whatever machine the server runs on, and
`serve` binds a port and stays up. `validate` and `forward` broke neither rule
and are still not tools: each mirrored its command closely enough to earn
nothing. What an agent drives instead is the served facade, which answers FHIR
over HTTP.

### Documentation

The graded `d2w fhir` series is this site, routed from
[the series index](index.md) - the "I am a..." router
(implementer / M&E configurer / integration developer / operator) and the full
101/201/301/401 page map.

**101 - Understand**

- [Glossary](glossary.md) - every DHIS2 and FHIR term the series
  uses, and what the toolchain does with it.
- [What `d2w fhir` is and why](101-what-and-why.md) - why a
  ministry publishes an IG, what each verb produces, what adopting the
  toolchain costs. No commands.
- [FHIR for DHIS2 people](101-fhir-concepts.md) - every FHIR
  term the series uses, explained in DHIS2 terms.
- [Quickstart: from nothing to a served IG](101-quickstart.md) -

  chain against one instance, phase by phase.
- [Set up an IG project](201-set-up-a-project.md) -

  check: severity as build impact, the scope column, the `--code-source` dial,
  report files, the CI exit-1 gate.

  targets, directory ownership and sync, selection narrowing, notes and
  validate echoes, site pages.
- [Build and publish the guide](201-build-and-publish.md) - the
  scaffolded Makefile, the three build knobs, registry scale, the two caches,
  publishing `ig/output/`.
- [Serve the guide](201-serve.md) - `d2w fhir serve` in both
  modes, `[serve]` in practice with the flag-beats-table-beats-default rule,
  receipts as the storage model, the strict/lenient dial across all four things
  it grades, the viewer posture, the spool on disk, and load sets.
- [Capture in the browser](201-capture-ui.md) - the capture UI
  page by page, with screenshots produced by a committed, skipped-by-default
  Playwright spec against the fixture suite server
  (`frontend/e2e/docs-screenshots.spec.ts`), including how to re-shoot them.
- [Forward captures into DHIS2](201-forward.md) - the
  dry-run-first workflow on DHIS2's own validate-only modes, the six steps of a
  run, the four receipt states, refusal versus rejection, the drain lock,
  reading the queue with `fhir spool` and putting a refused receipt back with
  `fhir requeue`, taking back a forwarded event with `fhir withdraw`, the
  translated-payload field tables, and a worked run with the rejection rollup.
- [Troubleshooting](201-troubleshooting.md) - every literal
  `d2w fhir` refusal plus the SUSHI / IG publisher failure modes, as symptom,
  cause, fix.

**301 - Configure `fhir.toml`**

scenario, an example, the default and leave-it-out behaviour, and the exact
refusal text a mistake produces, captured from real misconfigured runs.

- [The settings file: fhir.toml](301-fhir-toml.md) - what the
  file is, how commands discover it, the `fhir.toml` / `fhir.example.toml`

## FHIR Evaluation Engine

**Package:** `dhis2w-fhir-engine` | **Install:** `uv add dhis2w-fhir-engine`

Evaluate FHIRPath expressions, CQL libraries, and ELM against FHIR-shaped data,
and score CQL quality measures into a FHIR R4 `MeasureReport`.

The grammar, parser, AST, and evaluator layers are FHIR-version-neutral - FHIRPath
is normative and CQL is 1.5, and neither names a FHIR release. Everything that does
bind to a release reaches those layers as a `FhirVersionBinding` value out of
`dhis2w_fhir_engine.r4`, so R5 lands as a sibling subpackage rather than a fork of
the evaluator.

The package runs the official HL7 CQL and FHIRPath R4 compliance suites as part of
its own test run.

FHIRPath's aggregates are all four named functions beside the general `aggregate()`
fold: `sum()`, `min()`, `max()` and `avg()`, over numbers, quantities, strings and
dates as each accepts. An empty collection aggregates to the empty collection
rather than to zero, and a collection mixing kinds is refused with a message naming
both. See [FHIRPath](501-fhirpath.md#totalling-a-collection).

It ships the console script `d2w-fhir-engine` with `fhirpath`, `cql`, and `elm`
sub-apps over the same engine. Every command taking `--data` reads it by one rule:
a Bundle becomes the data source retrieves read, any other resource becomes the
context resource the evaluation is about. `cql measure` takes both halves off a
Bundle - each `Patient` entry is a person to evaluate, and the whole Bundle is
what the numerator retrieves from.

A measure report holds every decision per group: `populations_for(group_id)` and
`stratifier_values_for(group_id)` read one group's membership, and each group is
counted, scored, and stratified from its own state. A definition that cannot be
evaluated is recorded in `report.errors` with the patient, group, definition, and
message rather than counted as nonmembership; the group holding it carries no
`measure_score`, and `to_fhir()` emits `status: "error"` with a contained
`OperationOutcome` listing the failures.

It owns the R4 resource models at `dhis2w_fhir_engine.r4.resources`: `Patient`,
`Bundle`, `QuestionnaireResponse`, `Composition`, `Extension`, and the rest.
Every model is closed, frozen, and alias-aware, so
`model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)` reproduces the wire document
key for key. `dhis2w_fhir.r4` is the capture-facing facade re-exporting that
family, so a name is defined once and imported from whichever package a caller
already works in.

Every entry point that ingests a resource - the evaluation contexts, the
FHIRPath, CQL, and ELM evaluators, the data sources, the measure evaluator -
accepts either the wire dict or a pydantic model of it. A model is dumped once
on entry and evaluation reads dicts from there on, so nothing the engine does
reaches back into the caller's model.

It has no DHIS2 dependency and no web-framework dependency: it evaluates
expressions over FHIR-shaped JSON and returns values. It is the FHIR foundation
of the workspace rather than a leaf of it - `dhis2w-fhir` and `dhis2w-fhir-serve`
both depend on it.

- **Remote terminology lookups go over `httpx2`.** `FHIRTerminologyService`
  reaches an external FHIR terminology server through a synchronous
  `httpx2.Client`, because the terminology protocol the evaluator drives is
  synchronous. That call is why `httpx2` is a runtime dependency of this package.

- [`dhis2w_fhir_engine` API reference](api-dhis2w-fhir-engine.md) - the
  importable surface, module by module.
- [FHIRPath](501-fhirpath.md), [CQL](501-cql.md),
  [Quality measures](501-measures.md), and
  [The FHIR version binding](501-version-binding.md) - the 501 guide series.
- [`examples/engine/`](https://github.com/winterop-com/dhis2w-fhir/tree/main/examples/engine) -
  nine runnable examples, one feature apiece.

                        outranking the file. One drain at a time: an exclusive
                        flock on .serve/responses/.drain.lock names its holder.

                        strict_codes; a guide whose organisation units a registry

                        that package in both halves of the drain - the compiled
                        guide and the guide built off the instance alike - taking
                        the checkout [generate.organisation_units.registry] path
                        names first and --registry-package <package.tgz> after
                        it, and refusing before it connects when neither answers;
                        rejections roll up by cause (error code + the message
                        with its UIDs generalised away, quoted or bare, except
                        a row standing for one response, which keeps them) as a
                        reasons table on the terminal and at the head of the
                        report, so 202 rejections read as the 3 rules they
                        broke; a dry run counts a stage event whose enrollment
                        a registration of the same run creates as unverifiable
                        rather than rejected - it writes nothing, so there is
                        no enrollment to check the event against - and gets its
                        own count and section, while a stage event naming an
                        enrollment no registration of the run creates stays a
                        rejection; the exit code is 0 exactly when the queue
                        drained clean - nothing refused by the translator,
                        nothing rejected by DHIS2, and the drain reached the end
                        of the spool - and 1 on every other outcome, a dry run
                        whose only failures are unverifiable excepted; outcomes
                        go to reports/fhir-forward-report.md on every run with
                        one counted hint (--details prints them inline as well,

  Every command with an instance behind it narrates its steps on stderr - a
  spinner on a terminal, plain [k/N] lines when redirected - and takes
  --progress/--no-progress. Tables, notes, and progress are stderr; stdout
  carries the --json payload alone, so --json implies a silent stderr.



<!-- command tree -->

- **`examples/`**: the `d2w fhir` surface in its own group - 36 CLI scripts,
  one feature apiece (init/generate/validate, serve, forward, doctor, spool,
  sync) and 43 Python
  library examples grouped as build a response, read a form, convert to DHIS2,
  send and verify, say who a person is, summarise a record, and drive the
  toolchain. Every library one runs in `make verify-examples`
  against a shared `_fixture.py` that scaffolds a project, builds a translation
  context off the instance, and starts a live facade on a port the operating
  system picks. There are no MCP examples because there are no MCP tools: what
  an agent drives is the served facade, over HTTP.
- **`examples/igs/`**: nine complete `d2w fhir init` project trees, one
  per feature story - minimal aggregate, disaggregated aggregate, event program,
  tracker registration, strict terminology, district registry, mixed facility,
  patient summary, and the `refused-names` exhibit whose generate is refused by
  design. Each is committed as its inputs alone (`fhir.toml`, the SUSHI skeleton,
  the Makefile, the Dockerfile); nothing `d2w fhir generate` or SUSHI writes is,
  and `make clean-artifacts` sweeps what a run of the catalog left on disk. `make
  verify-igs` refreshes, validates, generates, and dockerized-SUSHI-compiles all
  nine - an on-demand target, because it needs a reachable DHIS2 instance and
  docker. The exhibit compiles nothing and is read on what its refusal left
  instead: the foundation target under `ig/input/fsh/`, nothing after it, and no
  compile beside it. Above that, `.github/workflows/publisher-check.yml` runs one full HL7
  IG Publisher build of `aggregate-minimal` weekly, so a publisher release that
  tightens validation shows up as a red scheduled run rather than in a user's
  project; `make publisher-check-summary QA=<qa.json>` reads the same report
  locally.
